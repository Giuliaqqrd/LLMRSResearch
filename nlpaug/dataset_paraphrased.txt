What are the benefits of smart energy management?

Climate Change: A Sustainability Champion is characterized by a deep-seated commitment to supporting and promoting activities that cut CO2 emissions. By actively participating in efforts to reduce carbon footprints, a Sustainability Champion helps to halt climate change and its damaging impact on society.

A Sustainability Champion demonstrates a dedication to reducing air, soil, and water pollution. By taking steps to minimize these forms of pollution, a Sustainability Champion works towards ensuring a cleaner, healthier environment for all living beings. This environmental value reflects a broader responsibility to protect natural resources and promote the well-being of ecosystems and communities.

Lastly, having at least a moderate understanding of policies and how they can be leveraged as incentives for the Energy Community is highly beneficial for a Sustainability Champion. Knowledge of national and regional policies, as well as community-specific incentives, enables better decision-making and maximizes the advantages offered by the regulatory framework. A Sustainability Champion uses this understanding to navigate and take full advantage of these incentives to benefit the community and the environment.

If someone wants to save energy at home, it will give them a competitive advantage. In an energy community, everyone’s efforts contribute to a shared goal: If all energy resources are saved, everyone can increase their consumption while saving money.

Sustainability Champion is able to implement the best technical solutions for carbon emissions and minimizing pollution, while maintaining an accelerated sustainable development agenda. This should not be ignored because sustainability is a process.

Moreover, a Sustainability Champion has a comprehensive understanding of the socio-economic cycle of energy production, distribution, and consumption. This includes knowledge of the various stakeholders involved, from energy producers and suppliers to consumers and regulators. A Sustainability Champion recognizes how these interconnected elements contribute to or hinder sustainability goals.

In addition, a Sustainability Champion has insight into which players within the energy system are making meaningful contributions to lowering emissions and minimizing pollution. By identifying the organizations, initiatives, or technologies that are leading the way in sustainability, a Sustainability Champion can support and amplify these efforts to accelerate progress toward a greener future.

As the energy sustainability community, each key stakeholders is required to provide the energy necessary to meet community needs. Energy providers supply and distribute power and power and their utility manage power lines and substations and are now increasingly adopting renewable energy sources. Consumers, or community members, are essential because their choices impact energy demand and sustainability.

How does the smart home technology contribute to self-sufficiency?

Intelligent home technology, like heat pump or Wi-Fi, can be programmed to use energy more efficiently, reducing waste. For example, a Smart Home thermostat can adjust the temperature based on when people are at home, helping save energy when it’s not needed. Smart Home technology can integrate with renewable energy such as solar panels, lights, and sensors.

Here a thoroughly explanation on the difference between self-sufficiency and self-consumption for non-experts.

When an energy community aims for self-sufficiency, the goal is to generate enough energy locally (typically through renewable sources like solar panels or wind turbines) to meet all or most of its members' energy needs without relying on external energy sources. In this model, the community strives to be as independent as possible from the larger power grid, reducing its dependency on external suppliers. Achieving full self-sufficiency is challenging, especially during times of low renewable generation (e.g., cloudy days

Self-Consumption: In contrast, “self-consumption” focuses on maximizing the use of energy that the community generates locally, rather than achieving complete independence. Here, the goal is for members to consume as much of their generated energy as possible on-site, reducing the need to export it back to the grid. Self-consumption strategies can also include demand management, where energy use is timed to match renewable production (like running appliances when the sun is shining for solar energy users).

How can we meet our electricity needs independently without the pressure of total self-sufficiency?

I'm a conservative energy consumer. I was skeptical and conservative energy consumer. I grew up as an American. I'm a conservative so I can't afford much to buy.

When making a change in energy consumption and production, this individual prefers to act independently rather than participating in group initiatives. In summary, this profile represents an individual who is resistant to change in the energy sector and skeptical of the value of cooperation.

The skeptical Values: A Study of: In philosophy and philosophy, 1869.

- Prioritizes cost-saving and economic efficiency over environmental considerations.

Government regulation and interventions in the energy market. - Demonstrates government regulation and intervention in the energy market. - Amount of disputes.

Skeptical of renewable energy technologies and their potential. - Skeptical of the renewable energy technologies and their capabilities.

- Believes in conserving traditional energy sources and industries. - Believes in preserving diversified energy sources and industries.

The skeptical Domain Knowledge: How is it analyzed in context?

- Familiar with fossil fuel-based energy systems and infrastructures and infrastructure to manage these issues on a macro level.

- Limited understanding of renewable energy technologies, their costs, and environmental impacts. -

Is it possible to transition to a green economy soon?

Lacks basic knowledge of climate change and sustainability principles.

The skeptical individual prioritizes cost-saving and economic efficiency over environmental considerations. For them, the primary focus is on financial practicality, often viewing environmental initiatives as secondary to the immediate goal of maximizing profits and minimizing expenses. They tend to favor solutions that offer clear economic benefits, regardless of their environmental impact.

The skeptical individual distrusts governments regulations and interventions in the energy market. They believe that government actions often create unnecessary bureaucracy, increase costs, and limit market competition. This skepticism extends to policies and incentives that aim to promote sustainability, as they view them as potentially restrictive and economically inefficient.

For these individuals, the transition to renewable energy may seem premature or unrealistic. These individuals also question the reliability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of renewable energy solutions, often believing that these technologies are still too unproven or costly to replace traditional energy sources.

As an individual skeptical towards renewable energy, they argue fossil energy is required and needed for a stable economy. They view attempts to phase them out as unrealistic or harmful to economic growth.

The skeptical individual is familiar with fossil fuel-based energy systems and infrastructure. They have a deep understanding of the traditional energy landscape, including the mechanisms of coal, oil, and natural gas production, distribution, and consumption. This familiarity leads them to believe that these systems are reliable and well-established, making them hesitant to embrace newer energy solutions.

I'm a first-time PV engineer. I have no idea if renewable energy is really that efficient, and whether they work in any way and in what ways. Also, it seems that I need a resource for this. As they are preparing their energy management plans, I have given them few opportunities. On the other hand, I know I don't have a simple energy plan that has all these features. I have some knowledge about how to achieve this.

The skeptical individual doubts the feasibility and scalability of transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewable energy on a large scale. They believe that shifting away from fossil fuels would be costly, disruptive, and difficult to achieve. They may argue that the infrastructure and technology required for such a transition are not yet ready or economically viable.

Secondly, the skeptical individual lacks in-depth knowledge of climate change science and sustainability principles. While they may be aware of basic environmental issues, they may not fully understand the scientific consensus on climate change or the urgency of adopting sustainable practices. This lack of detailed knowledge makes them less inclined to support policies or technologies aimed at mitigating environmental impact.

WIKIPEDIA / WIKIPEDIA Sr.lam:

Definition of Energy Community: Energy community is a political and legal concept of democratisation, decentralisation of energy/energy services and their collective ownership in the EU. In 2019 European Union adopted "The Clean Energy for All Europeans package" to promote and encourage engagement of all its citizens in climate protection and energy transition. The package introduced new (besides prosumers) political and legal entities of energy communities, namely: citizen energy community (CEC) and renewable energy community (REC).

Renewable energy communities were incorporated already in 2018 in the Directive on the promotion of the use of renewable resources (recast, RED II). REC is a legal entity: if the market was fully polluted by renewable energy units, renewable energy communities would be disproportionately affected...

c) which, in accordance with the applicable national law, is based on open and voluntary participation, is autonomous, and is effectively controlled by shareholders or members that are located in proximity of renewable energy projects that are owned and developed by that legal entity;

b) the shareholders or members of which are natural persons, SMEs or local authorities, including municipalities; having subsidiaries:

c) the purpose of which is to provide environmental, economic or social community benefits for its shareholders or members or for the local areas where it operates, rather than financial profits.

Energy conservation is the effort to reduce wasteful energy consumption by using fewer energy services. This can be done by using energy more effectively (using less and better sources of energy for continuous service) or changing one's behavior to use less and better source of service (for example, by driving vehicles which consume renewable energy or energy with more efficiency). Energy conservation can be achieved through efficient energy use, which has some advantages, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a smaller carbon footprint, as well as cost, water and energy savings.

Green engineering practices improve the life cycle of the components of machines which convert energy from one form to another.

Energy uses can be determined by identifying energy consumption and spending patterns, establishing a data usage profile, and revealing energy use patterns in circumstances where energy is used poorly. On a large scale, a few factors affect energy consumption trends, including political issues, technological developments, economic growth, and environmental concerns.

Do people have energy conservation rights? Why or why not?

Determination of energy consumption can be achieved by providing recommendations for improving user habits contributes to energy conservation. Micro-moments are essential in realizing energy consumption patterns and are identified using a variety of sensing units positioned in prominent areas across the home. The micro-moment is an event that changes the state of the appliance from inactive to active and helps in building user's energy consumption profiles according to their activities. Unnecessary energy usage can be decreased by selecting a suitable scheduling system.

Renewable energy, or green energy, are relatively new technologies. Most large renewable energy projects use renewable sources of energy. The major single sources of renewable power are wind and solar power.

Energy conservation measures have primarily focused on technological innovations to improve efficiencies and financial incentives with theoretical explanations obtained from the mentioned analytical traditions. Existing buildings can improve energy efficiency by changing structural maintenance materials, adjusting the composition of air conditioning systems, and selecting energy-saving equipment. These measures can improve users' thermal comfort and reduce building's environmental impact. The selection of combinatorial optimization schemes that contain measures to guide and restrict users' behavior in addition to carrying out demand side management can dynamically adjust energy consumption.

Energy communities: Citizen-driven energy actions that contribute to the clean energy transition, advancing energy efficiency within local communities. Energy communities enable collective and citizen-driven energy actions to support the clean energy transition. They can contribute to increasing public acceptance of renewable energy projects and make it easier to attract private investments in the clean energy transition. Energy communities can be an effective means of re-structuring our energy systems, by empowering citizens to drive the energy transition locally and directly benefit from better energy efficiency, lower bills, reduced energy poverty and more local green job

Energy communities allow local communities to join forces and invest in clean energy. Acting as a single entity means energy communities can access all suitable energy markets on a level playing field with other market actors. Under EU law, energy communities can take the form of any legal entity including an association, a cooperative, a partnership, a non-profit organisation or a private company.

Clean Energy for All Europe: The package, adopted in 2019, will help to decarbonise EU’s energy system in line with the European Green Deal objectives.

The UK and the EU have withdrawn their energy cooperation agreements and merged their efforts to accelerate their transition from fossil fuels to cleaner fuels. In 2019, the EU will consider turning to renewable energy if the Paris Agreement is not delivered on its commitments.

The introduction of a new energy rulebook, the Clean Energy for all Europeans (Clean energy for all Europeans) has marked a significant step towards implementing the energy union strategy, published in 2015. It will provide a clear picture of the environment and environment for all of Europe.

Based on the Commission proposals published in 2016, the package consists of 8 new laws. Following political agreement by the EU Council and the European Parliament (finalised in May 2019) and the entry into force of the different EU rules, EU countries have 1-2 years to convert the new directives into national laws.

The new rules will bring substantial benefits for consumers, the environment, and for the economy. By coordinating these changes at EU level, the legislation also underlines EU leadership in tackling global warming and makes an important contribution to the EU's long term strategy of achieving carbon neutrality (net-zero emissions) by 2050.

As a leader for renewables, the European Parliament has set a target of 32% of renewable energy sources in the EU’s energy mix by 2030. The revised renewable energy Directive (2018/2001/EU), which contains this commitment, entered into force in December 2018.

Skepticism is a doubt attitude (or questioning attitude) concerning knowledge claims that are seen as mere belief. For example, if a person is skeptical about claims made by their government about an ongoing war then the person doubts that these claims are accurate. In such cases, skeptics normally recommend not disbelief but suspension of belief, i.e. maintaining a neutral attitude that neither affirms nor denies the claim. This attitude is often motivated by the impression that the available evidence is insufficient to support

As part of the global effort to limit climate change, most countries have committed to net zero greenhouse gas emissions. In practice, this means phasing out fossil fuels and replacing them with low-emissions energy sources. This much needed process, coined as "low-carbon substitutions", needs to be accelerated multiple times in order to mitigate climate change.

EUROPE - DOCUMENTS TOGETHER ADOPTIVES, ORCHESTICS, KNOWLEDGE AND CONFORMITY

European consumers are significantly more discerning about a brand’s commitment to sustainability than consumers in other regions, according to new research from brand-valuation consultancy Brand Finance.

Brand Finance Global Brand Equity Monitor (GBEM) — which surveyed over 150,000 respondents across 16 European and 24 non-European markets — reveals that European respondents are 25 percent less likely to agree that a brand is committed to environmental sustainability, 26 percent less likely to buy into social sustainability claims, and 22 percent less likely to agree on governance, compared to non-European respondents.

What are the major differences in consumer attitudes across Europe, having dominated by the Swedish Consumer Group (US) and the UK. Switzerland is the most skeptical, with 23 percent disagreed that brands are committed to sustainability — followed by Scandinavia (20 percent), and its consumers in Mexico (39 percent) and iran (20 percent).

"Brand Finance's research consistently shows that perceptions of corporate brands vary significantly across regions, with sustainability being a key area where European consumers set a higher standard,” says Rob Haigh, Strategy & Sustainability Director at Brand Finance, a leading global brand. "Europe continues to lead in sustainability regulations, particularly with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).

“Sustainability claims must always be genuine and supported by real practices," he added. "But this is particularly true in Europe — where any real or perceived greenwashing is likely to be more rapidly exposed."

How Can You Make SCIENTIFIC PAPERS?

In the context of sustainable development, sustainability is defined as a form of intergenerational ethics.

The issue of understanding of climate change and sustainability touches on many other research issues and questions like the public’s trust in science; attitudes to, and understanding of, risk perception; and the spread of conspiracy theories. Moreover, interest in this area has led to an interest in a number of interesting and important topics, like geo-engineering and transitioning to a green economy, which is well beyond the scope of this review.

First, nature-related principles aim to decarbonize, reduce the human environmental impact by efficiency, sufficiency, and consistency; be net-positive; prefer local, seasonal, plant-based, and labor-intensive; and esped the polluter-pays principle. Second, personal principles aim to practice contemplation, apply policies with caution, and celebrate frugality. Fourth, systems-related principles aim to apply systems thinking; foster diversity; be more transparent; and maintain or increase option diversity. This emphasizes the multi-

There is a deeply ideological component to the concept of sustainability. There is also the issue of the extent to which people support the essential goals of sustainability as they understand them. Assuming one can assess reliably and validly some of the features of sustainability, there are inevitable individual differences in the extent to which certain claims are thought to be true. There are also differences in perceived means and the ends (i.e., how to be sustainable).

In some parts of the world, the most clear focus of this issue is probably probably climate change and biodiversity loss. Both of these issues have been heavily politicized: the scientific findings have been challenged and all recommendations for behavioral change have been, and are constantly, debated.

Why do people become so cynical and skeptical of the messages of many climate scientists. It looks at the research that attempted to differentiate between different skeptical positions, be it using a dimensional or categorical approach. The major concern of many researchers is to understand how and why people reject certain messages and, therefore, how their views may be changed.

It appears that regardless of how worldviews are measured (e.g., political conservatism or free-market libertarianism), a strong and robust correlation (accounting for up to 50% of the variance) emerges between right-wing political attitudes and CC skepticism.

It has very little interest in socio-political liberalism than conservatism. But, like psychologists, which interests and puzzles them, sociologists undertake that opposite – namely, investigating deviance.

With respect to sustainability skepticism, Wilson developed a psychological and a test of conservatism that has generated significant interest. Wilson suggested that conservative attitudes are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors that shape feelings of insecurity and a desire to preserve stability. The common thread of this syndrome is the susceptibility to experience threat or anxiety when faced with uncertainty. Individuals with a conservative outlook on environmental issues often seek to avoid uncertainty both in terms of environmental changes and the responses to them, favoring approaches that emphasize stability, preservation,

Energy communities and consumer ownership in renewable energy (RE) are essential cornerstones of the Energy Transition. When consumers acquire ownership in RE installations, they become prosumers, generating a share of the energy they consume. This not only helps reduce their overall energy expenditure but also provides an additional source of income through the sale of excess production.

What is responsible for prosumership for energy generation, supply and management are expected to grow in number on an annual basis, in the context of the proliferation of energy resources. In our paper, we define this evolving landscape as “renewable energy clusters” (RE clusters).

Nonetheless, the governance model of energy clusters and the engineering model of energy communities are recognized in practice. Furthermore, clear and standardized definitions are still emerging.

Human needs evolved at the age of 15 and these are all important psychological needs of an individual. Human values began with exploration of fundamental human needs. One of the earliest frameworks identified five basic needs: physiological, safety, love, esteem, and self-actualization.

Further research on values at the individual level emphasized their intrinsic importance, independent of external objects or events. Values can be categorized into two main types: terminal values, which represent ideal end states or ultimate life goals, and instrumental values, which define the behaviors and virtues necessary to achieve those goals. While terminal values reflect aspirations for an ideal society or personal fulfillment, instrumental values guide the actions needed to reach those aspirations.

Customer Value is typically measured using Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), which represents the net profit a customer generates for a company over their lifetime and can be expressed in monetary terms.

Is value primarily a measure of financial profit?

This study defines value by merging various perspectives and addressing the ambiguity of existing definitions. It introduces three key terms: life value, user value, and product/service value.

Life value refers to desirable states of existence or modes of behavior. Desirable states of existence—such as freedom, equality, and salvation—represent ideal future conditions individuals aspire to reach. Modes of behavior—such as self-control, honesty, and generosity—refer to guiding principles that individuals establish for themselves.

As a subset of life value, user value is directly linked to a particular product or service. The elements of user value vary depending on the product or service in question.

What is the difference between user value and product value, when they are categorized into the terms customer value, service value, or quality value?

Life Value, User Value, Product/Service Value is dynamic. User Value elements of a given product or service can influence life value elements of a given individual, while life value elements, in turn, shape user value elements. The concept of user experience refers to all aspects of interactions between a user and a product or service, whereas life experience encompasses everything that happens to an individual, contributing to knowledge, emotions, and skills.

My writing is based on two basic assumptions: I am a lawyer and foreigner. A lawyer is a lawyer, and I am to study more now. If I do not, I can't help myself, and have no idea what I can do to solve it myself, this study is based on two fundamental assumptions, I don't know what the answer will be; I am going to find out how I can solve it myself, and I don't know what the solution will be. If I do not understand it than I

"Value" is a multi-dimensional construct – An individual may pursue multiple value elements simultaneously.

The influence of value elements on user behavior depends on context – Situational factors, such as personal circumstances and external conditions, impact how value is perceived and pursued.

Previous research has highlighted the role of context in shaping value. For instance, human needs may diminish after being satisfied, and situational variables—including physical surroundings, social environments, time constraints, task definitions, and prior conditions—affect behavior. While understanding these situational influences is important, this study focuses primarily on clarifying user value itself. Future research may explore the role of personality, attitudes, and situational factors in shaping user value.

Numerous definitions of consumer value are rooted in the economic paradigm, where value is primarily determined by the monetary sacrifice individuals are willing to make for a product. This perspective emphasizes the point of exchange, with money serving as a key indicator of value. The assumption is that, at the moment of purchase, consumers engage in a rational evaluation, weighing the cost against the perceived quality of the product.

In the context of design, however, the approach may be limiting, particularly in the context of use, as it neglects the situation of use. Studies on consumer value suggest that non-monetary factors also play a crucial role in shaping perceptions of value. For example, when assessing fruit beverages, factors such as time and effort required for preparation influences how users perceive product value.

Is being money for product quality an adequate way to establish a value for customers?
