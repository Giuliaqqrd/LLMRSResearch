Here’s an explanation of energy saving impact for a non-expert: When you save energy at home—like turning off lights when you don’t need them, using energy-efficient appliances, or lowering the thermostat—you’re reducing the total amount of energy your household uses.
Even though these actions may seem small, they add up, especially when many people in your community do the same.
In an energy community, everyone’s efforts to save energy contribute to a shared goal.
By using less energy, the community relies less on external sources (like the main power grid), which reduces costs, lowers emissions, and can even make the community more sustainable.
When everyone works together to save energy, it reduces the demand on shared resources, making the energy system more efficient and resilient.
So, your energy-saving choices at home don’t just benefit you; that helps make a positive impact on the entire community’s energy use.
A Sustainability Champion possesses a clear grasp of actions that positively impact CO2 reduction and pollution control.
By understanding the most effective strategies and technologies for reducing carbon emissions and minimizing pollution, a Sustainability Champion is able to implement and advocate for solutions that drive significant environmental change.
Moreover, a Sustainability Champion has a comprehensive understanding of the socio-economic cycle of energy production, distribution, and consumption.
This includes knowledge of the various stakeholders involved, from energy producers and suppliers to consumers and regulators.
A Sustainability Champion recognizes how these interconnected elements contribute to or hinder sustainability goals.
Additionally, a Sustainability Champion has insight into which players within the energy system are making meaningful contributions to lowering emissions and minimizing pollution.
By identifying the organizations, initiatives, or technologies that are leading the way in sustainability, a Sustainability Champion can support and amplify these efforts to accelerate progress toward a greener future.
Here’s a comprehensive explanation for non-experts of the inter-dependency among key stakeholders of energy communities: the energy community involves several key stakeholders, each playing a unique role in fostering a sustainable and resilient energy system.
Energy providers supply and distribute electricity, ensuring a stable and reliable flow of energy to meet community needs.
They also manage infrastructure like power lines and substations and are increasingly adopting renewable energy sources.
Government bodies and regulators create the policy framework that supports the transition to clean energy by setting standards, providing incentives, and implementing regulations that encourage efficiency and the use of renewables.
Consumers, or community members, are essential because their choices impact energy demand and sustainability.
By conserving energy, using efficient appliances, and generating their own energy (e.g., with solar panels), they help reduce overall demand and emissions.
Technology & service providers supply the necessary tools—like solar panels, smart meters, and energy management systems—that make it easier for both consumers and providers to generate, store, and use energy efficiently.
Finally, community organizations serve as a bridge, educating and engaging members to build awareness and support for energy-saving initiatives.
They foster collaboration among stakeholders and empower individuals to take an active role in the energy transition.
Together, these stakeholders contribute to a community’s self-sufficiency, sustainability, and resilience in managing energy resources.
Here’s an explanation of smart home technologies contribution to achieve self-sufficiency tailored for non-experts:

Advanced smart home technology helps an energy community become more self-sufficient by making it easier for individual homes to manage, produce, and store their own energy.
Smart devices—like thermostats, appliances, and lighting systems—can be programmed to use energy more efficiently, reducing waste.
For example, a smart thermostat can adjust the temperature based on when people are at home, helping save energy when it’s not needed.
In addition, smart home technology can integrate with renewable energy sources like solar panels.
For instance, a home with solar panels and a battery system can use its own solar energy during the day and store any extra energy for use at night or on cloudy days.
Smart technology can also track when the sun is shining the most and automatically run certain appliances during those times, reducing the need to rely on energy from the main grid.
By reducing energy waste and using more locally generated renewable energy, advanced smart home systems allow a community to use less power from external sources.
This not only lowers electricity bills for everyone involved but also supports the community’s goal of becoming more energy-independent and environmentally friendly.
In other words, smart home technology helps each household contribute to a more sustainable, self-sufficient community.
Here a thoroughly explanation on the difference between self-sufficiency and self-consumption for non-experts

Self-Sufficiency: When an energy community aims for “self-sufficiency”, the goal is to generate enough energy locally (typically through renewable sources like solar panels or wind turbines) to meet all or most of its members' energy needs without relying on external energy sources.
In this model, the community strives to be as independent as possible from the larger power grid, reducing its dependency on external suppliers.
Achieving full self-sufficiency is challenging, especially during times of low renewable generation (e.g., cloudy days or calm weather), so it often requires storage solutions, like batteries, to store surplus energy for later use.
Self-Consumption: In contrast, “self-consumption” focuses on maximizing the use of the energy that the community generates locally, rather than achieving complete independence.
Here, the goal is for members to consume as much of their generated energy as possible on-site, reducing the need to export it back to the grid.
This approach helps community members make the most of their renewable production, potentially lowering energy bills and improving energy efficiency.
Self-consumption strategies can also include demand management, where energy use is timed to match renewable production (like running appliances when the sun is shining for solar energy users).
Key Difference between Self-sufficiency and Self-Consumption: in summary, “self-sufficiency” is about meeting all energy needs independently, aiming for energy independence.
“Self-consumption” is about optimizing the use of locally produced energy, without necessarily aiming for full independence from the grid.
An energy community may adopt a self-consumption strategy as a step toward greater energy independence but without the pressure of achieving total self-sufficiency.

WIKIPEDIA
Definition of Energy Community: Energy community is a political and legal concept of democratisation, decentralisation of energy/energy services and their collective ownership in the EU.
In 2019 European Union adopted "the Clean energy for all Europeans package" to promote and encourage engagement of all its citizens in climate protection and energy transition.
The package introduced new (in addition to prosumers) political and legal entities of energy communities, namely: citizen energy community (CEC) and renewable energy community (REC).
Each type of energy community was incorporated in a different EU directive.
Renewable energy communities were incorporated already in 2018 in the Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (recast, RED II).
REC is a legal entity:

a) which, in accordance with the applicable national law, is based on open and voluntary participation, is autonomous, and is effectively controlled by shareholders or members that are located in the proximity of the renewable energy projects that are owned and developed by that legal entity;

b) the shareholders or members of which are natural persons, SMEs or local authorities, including municipalities;

c) the primary purpose of which is to provide environmental, economic or social community benefits for its shareholders or members or for the local areas where it operates, rather than financial profits.
Energy conservation is the effort to reduce wasteful energy consumption by using fewer energy services.
This can be done by using energy more effectively (using less and better sources of energy for continuous service) or changing one's behavior to use less and better source of service (for example, by driving vehicles which consume renewable energy or energy with more efficiency).
Energy conservation can be achieved through efficient energy use, which has some advantages, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a smaller carbon footprint, as well as cost, water, and energy savings.
Green engineering practices improve the life cycle of the components of machines which convert energy from one form into another.
Energy can be conserved by reducing waste and losses, improving efficiency through technological upgrades, improving operations and maintenance, changing users' behaviors through user profiling or user activities, monitoring appliances, shifting load to off-peak hours, and providing energy-saving recommendations.
Observing appliance usage, establishing an energy usage profile, and revealing energy consumption patterns in circumstances where energy is used poorly, can pinpoint user habits and behaviors in energy consumption.
Appliance energy profiling helps identify inefficient appliances with high energy consumption and energy load.
Seasonal variations also greatly influence energy load, as more air-conditioning is used in warmer seasons and heating in colder seasons.
Achieving a balance between energy load and user comfort is complex yet essential for energy preservation.
On a large scale, a few factors affect energy consumption trends, including political issues, technological developments, economic growth, and environmental concerns.
User oriented energy conservation: User behavior has a significant effect on energy conservation.
It involves user activity detection, profiling, and appliance interaction behaviors.
User profiling consists of the identification of energy usage patterns of the user and replacing required system settings with automated settings that can be initiated on request.
Within user profiling, personal characteristics are instrumental in affecting energy conservation behavior.
These characteristics include household income, education, gender, age, and social norms.
User behavior also relies on the impact of personality traits, social norms, and attitudes on energy conservation behavior.
Beliefs and attitudes toward a convenient lifestyle, environmentally friendly transport, energy security, and residential location choices affect energy conservation behavior.
As a result, energy conservation can be made possible by adopting pro-environmental behavior and energy-efficient systems.
Education on approaches to energy conservation can result in wise energy use.
The choices made by the users yield energy usage patterns.
Rigorous analysis of these usage patterns identifies waste energy patterns, and improving those patterns may reduce significant energy load.
Therefore, human behavior is critical to determining the implications of energy conservation measures and solving environmental problems.
Substantial energy conservation may be achieved if users' habit loops are modified.
User habits: User habits significantly impact energy demand; thus, providing recommendations for improving user habits contributes to energy conservation.
Micro-moments are essential in realizing energy consumption patterns and are identified using a variety of sensing units positioned in prominent areas across the home.
The micro-moment is an event that changes the state of the appliance from inactive to active and helps in building users' energy consumption profiles according to their activities.
Energy conservation can be achieved through user habits by following energy-saving recommendations at micro-moments.
Unnecessary energy usage can be decreased by selecting a suitable schedule for appliance operation.
Creating an effective scheduling system requires an understanding of user habits regarding appliances.
Renewable energy (also called green energy) is energy made from renewable natural resources that are replenished on a human timescale.
The most widely used renewable energy types are solar energy, wind power, and hydropower.
Bioenergy and geothermal power are also significant in some countries.
Some also consider nuclear power a renewable power source, although this is controversial, as nuclear energy requires mining uranium, a nonrenewable resource.
Renewable energy installations can be large or small and are suited for both urban and rural areas.
Renewable energy is often deployed together with further electrification.
This has several benefits: electricity can move heat and vehicles efficiently and is clean at the point of consumption.
[1][2] Variable renewable energy sources are those that have a fluctuating nature, such as wind power and solar power.
In contrast, controllable renewable energy sources include dammed hydroelectricity, bioenergy, or geothermal power.
Energy conservation measures have primarily focused on technological innovations to improve efficiencies and financial incentives with theoretical explanations obtained from the mentioned analytical traditions.
Existing buildings can improve energy efficiency by changing structural maintenance materials, adjusting the composition of air conditioning systems, selecting energy-saving equipment, and formulating subsidy policies.
These measures can improve users' thermal comfort and reduce buildings' environmental impact.
The selection of combinatorial optimization schemes that contain measures to guide and restrict users' behavior in addition to carrying out demand-side management can dynamically adjust energy consumption.
At the same time, economic means should enable users to change their behavior and achieve a low-carbon life.
Combination optimization and pricing incentives reduce building energy consumption and carbon emissions and reduce users' costs.
Energy communities: Citizen-driven energy actions that contribute to the clean energy transition, advancing energy efficiency within local communities.
Energy communities enable collective and citizen-driven energy actions to support the clean energy transition.
They can contribute to increasing public acceptance of renewable energy projects and make it easier to attract private investments in the clean energy transition.
Energy communities can be an effective means of re-structuring our energy systems, by empowering citizens to drive the energy transition locally and directly benefit from better energy efficiency, lower bills, reduced energy poverty and more local green job opportunities.
Energy communities allow local communities to join forces and invest in clean energy.
Acting as a single entity means energy communities can access all suitable energy markets on a level-playing field with other market actors.
Under EU law, energy communities can take the form of any legal entity including an association, a cooperative, a partnership, a non-profit organisation or a limited liability company.
Clean energy for all Europeans package: The package, adopted in 2019, will help to decarbonise EU’s energy system in line with the European Green Deal objectives.
n 2019 the EU overhauled its energy policy framework to help us move away from fossil fuels towards cleaner energy - and, more specifically, to deliver on the EU’s Paris Agreement commitments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
The agreement on this new energy rulebook – called the Clean energy for all Europeans package – marked a significant step towards implementing the energy union strategy, published in 2015.
Based on Commission proposals published in 2016, the package consists of 8 new laws.
Following political agreement by the EU Council and the European Parliament (finalised in May 2019) and the entry into force of the different EU rules, EU countries have 1-2 years to convert the new directives into national law.
The new rules will bring considerable benefits for consumers, the environment, and for the economy.
By coordinating these changes at EU level, the legislation also underlines EU leadership in tackling global warming and makes an important contribution to the EU’s long-term strategy of achieving carbon neutrality (net-zero emissions) by 2050.
To show global leadership on renewables, the EU has set an ambitious, binding target of 32% for renewable energy sources in the EU’s energy mix by 2030.
The revised Renewable Energy Directive (2018/2001/EU), which contains this commitment, entered into force in December 2018.
Skepticism (also spelled scepticism in British English) is a questioning attitude or doubt toward knowledge claims that are seen as mere belief or dogma.
For example, if a person is skeptical about claims made by their government about an ongoing war then the person doubts that these claims are accurate.
In such cases, skeptics normally recommend not disbelief but suspension of belief, i.e.
maintaining a neutral attitude that neither affirms nor denies the claim.
This attitude is often motivated by the impression that the available evidence is insufficient to support the claim.
Formally, skepticism is a topic of interest in philosophy, particularly epistemology.
As part of the global effort to limit climate change, most countries have committed to net zero greenhouse gas emissions.
In practice, this means phasing out fossil fuels and replacing them with low-emissions energy sources.
This much needed process, coined as "low-carbon substitutions" in contrast to other transition processes including energy additions, needs to be accelerated multiple times in order to successfully mitigate climate change.
[25] At the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference, around three-quarters of the world's countries set a goal of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030.
The European Union aims to generate 40% of its electricity from renewables by the same year.
EUROPEAN DOCUMENTS

European consumers are significantly more discerning about a brand’s commitment to sustainability than consumers in other regions, according to new research from brand-valuation consultancy Brand Finance.
Brand Finance’s Global Brand Equity Monitor (GBEM) — which surveyed over 150,000 respondents across 16 European and 24 non-European markets — reveals that European respondents are 25 percent less likely to agree that a brand is committed to environmental sustainability, 26 percent less likely to buy into social sustainability claims, and 22 percent less likely to agree on governance, compared to non-European respondents.
Further analysis shows significant differences within Europe itself.
Swiss consumers are the most skeptical — with 23 percent disagreeing that brands are committed to environmental sustainability — followed by consumers in the Netherlands (21 percent), Denmark (20 percent), and Norway (20 percent).
“Brand Finance’s research consistently shows that perceptions of corporate brands vary significantly across regions, with sustainability being a key area where European consumers set a higher standard,” explains Rob Haigh, Strategy & Sustainability Director at Brand Finance.
“Sustainability has been a demand driver in Europe for longer than anywhere else; consumer awareness of a range of sustainability issues is high; and Europe continues to lead in sustainability regulations, particularly with the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).
“Sustainability claims must always be genuine and supported by real practices," he added.
"But this is particularly true in Europe — where any real or perceived greenwashing is likely to be more rapidly exposed.
Sustainability Perceptions Value: 
- the role of sustainability in driving consumer choice
- which brands consumers believe to be most committed to sustainability
- the proportion of brand value attributable to sustainability perceptions, and the value at risk or to be gained, based on the difference between sustainability perceptions and actual performance.
MASTERPIECE: Advancing Energy Communities in Europe
MASTERPIECE is a digital coordination and cooperation platform designed to facilitate the creation and operation of energy communities across Europe.
The project emphasizes a participative-by-design approach, ensuring that community members actively contribute to services and ongoing developments.
Phased Implementation and Pilot Sites
MASTERPIECE adopts a phased implementation strategy, leveraging real-world use cases with varying levels of maturity and technological readiness.
To validate and evaluate the proposed innovations, the project will engage four pilot sites across different geographical and regulatory landscapes: France, Italy, Sweden, and Turkey.
Key Development Areas
algoWatt, a project partner, is leading the development of tools aligned with business solutions for energy communities, focusing on:

Interactive decision-support simulations for sustainable energy investments in renewable energy communities.
Governance, management, and operation of diverse renewable energy communities.
The MASTERPIECE initiative aims to:
Empower energy consumers by integrating technical and social innovations, transforming them into active participants in collaborative energy communities.
Develop user-centric solutions that leverage participatory approaches, such as co-creation, to enhance citizen engagement.
Introduce new business strategies and incentives to attract market participants seeking energy cost reduction and efficiency-driven business opportunities.
Ensure a robust cybersecurity framework, protecting active citizens from cyber threats while upholding privacy regulations, including GDPR and EPBD requirements.
Demonstrate scalability and replicability, applying methodological, technical, and business innovations across real-life pilot sites with diverse socio-economic and regulatory conditions.
By addressing these challenges, MASTERPIECE aims to pave the way for a new energy market paradigm, fostering a more sustainable, participatory, and secure energy ecosystem.
SCIENTIFIC PAPERS
One definition of sustainability is essentially meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs.
The Encyclopedia Brittanica defines it thus: “Sustainability [is] the long-term viability of a community, set of social institutions, or societal practice.
In general, sustainability is understood as a form of intergenerational ethics in which the environmental and economic actions taken by present persons do not diminish the opportunities of future persons to enjoy similar levels of wealth, utility, or welfare”.
The issue of the understanding of climate change and sustainability touches on many other research issues and questions like the public’s trust in science; attitudes to, and understanding of, risk perception; and the spread of conspiracy theories.
Moreover, interest in this area has led to an interest in a number of interesting and important topics, like geo-engineering and transitioning to a green economy, which is well beyond the scope of this review.
This means that a wide range of experts from different disciplines have been interested and involved in research in this area, such as those in communication studies, political science, and sociology.
Berg has suggested there are four practice principles in this area.
First, nature-related principles aim to decarbonize, reduce the human environmental impact by efficiency, sufficiency, and consistency; be net-positive; prefer local, seasonal, plant-based, and labor-intensive; and espouse the polluter-pays principle and the precautionary principle.
Second, personal principles aim to practice contemplation, apply policies with caution, and celebrate frugality.
Third, society-related principles grant the least privileged the greatest support; seek mutual understanding and trust; strengthen social cohesion and collaboration; engage stakeholders; and foster education.
Fourth, systems-related principles aim to apply systems thinking; foster diversity; be more transparent; and maintain or increase option diversity.
This emphasizes the multi-disciplinary approach required by those working in this area.
It is important to recognize that there is a deeply ideological component to the concept of sustainability.
There is also the issue of the extent to which people support the essential goals of sustainability as they understand them.
Assuming one can assess reliably and validly some, or all, of the features of sustainability, there are inevitable individual differences in the extent to which certain claims are thought to be true.
There are also differences in the perceived means and the ends (i.e., how to be sustainable).
Many are interested in what motivates people to be sustainability change agents.
Equally, there is a vast interest in those who are seen to reject the “message of sustainability”.
The most clear focus of this issue is probably climate change and biodiversity loss.
Both of these issues have been heavily politicized: the scientific findings have been challenged and all recommendations for behavioral change have been, and are constantly, debated.
In this sense, there are those who reject many of the findings and implications of environmental sustainability.
why people become cynical and skeptical of the messages of many climate scientists.
It looks at the research that has attempted to differentiate between different skeptical positions, be it using a dimensional or categorical approach.
The major concern of many researchers is to understand how and why people reject certain messages and, therefore, how their views may be changed.
It appears that regardless of how worldviews are measured (e.g., political conservatism or free-market libertarianism), a strong and robust correlation (accounting for up to 50% of the variance) emerges between right-wing political attitudes and CC skepticism.
In the psychological literature, much less interest in socio-political liberalism than conservatism, possibly because many researchers are themselves politically liberal and, thus, do not see it as an issue or problem worthy of investigation.
Indeed, just as psychologists study conformity, which interests and puzzles them, sociologists undertake the opposite, namely, investigating deviancy.
The psychological literature on socio-economic beliefs seems almost completely devoid of research in terms of measures and theories on socio-political or economic liberalism.
A concept closely linked to sustainability skepticism is that of environmental conservatism.
Wilson developed a psychological  and a test of conservatism that has generated significant interest.
Wilson suggested that conservative attitudes, as a syndrome, are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors that shape feelings of insecurity and a desire to preserve stability.
The common thread of this syndrome is the susceptibility to experience threat or anxiety when faced with uncertainty.
Individuals with a conservative outlook on environmental issues often seek to avoid uncertainty both in terms of environmental changes and the responses to them, favoring approaches that emphasize stability, preservation, and caution in the face of ecological challenges.
Energy communities and consumer (co-)ownership in renewable energy (RE) are essential cornerstones of the Energy Transition.
When consumers acquire ownership in RE installations, they become prosumers—generating a share of the energy they consume.
This not only helps reduce their overall energy expenditure but also provides an additional source of income through the sale of excess production.
Prosumership is expected to be increasingly integrated into energy communities, which involve a broad variety of actors.
From a technical perspective, these organizational shifts in energy generation, supply, and management occur within the context of the growing complexity of energy systems.
In this paper, we define this evolving landscape as “renewable energy clusters” (RE clusters).
Although both the governance model of energy communities and the engineering model of energy clusters are recognized in practice, comprehensive regulation remains a novelty.
Consequently, clear and standardized definitions are still emerging.
Studies on individual values began with an exploration of fundamental human needs.
One of the earliest frameworks identified five basic needs: physiological, safety, love, esteem, and self-actualization.
Physiological needs are the most fundamental and must be satisfied before an individual seeks higher-level needs.
However, this hierarchy is not absolute, as some individuals may prioritize social belonging even when physiological needs remain unmet.
Further research on values at the individual level emphasized their intrinsic importance, independent of external objects or events.
Values can be categorized into two main types: terminal values, which represent ideal end states or ultimate life goals, and instrumental values, which define the behaviors and virtues necessary to achieve those goals.
While terminal values reflect aspirations for an ideal society or personal fulfillment, instrumental values guide the actions needed to reach those aspirations.
The final perspective on value considers it in monetary terms.
Many studies in this area have focused on customer equity through quantitative analyses in marketing.
Customer value is often defined as the total discounted lifetime value of all current and potential customers of a firm.
This value is typically measured using Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), which represents the net profit a customer generates for a company over their lifetime and can be expressed in monetary terms.
However, the present study aims to explore value as an abstract and complex concept at the individual level, rather than as a measure of financial profit for businesses.
While some marketing researchers emphasize value primarily in monetary terms, this study focuses on broader, non-materialistic dimensions of value.
This study defines value by merging various perspectives and addressing the ambiguity of existing definitions.
It introduces three key terms: life value, user value, and product/service value.
Life value refers to desirable states of existence or modes of behavior.
Desirable states of existence—such as freedom, equality, and salvation—represent ideal future conditions individuals aspire to reach.
Modes of behavior—such as self-control, honesty, and generosity—refer to guiding principles that individuals establish for themselves.
In this study, the term value is synonymous with life value.
User value is defined as desirable states of existence or modes of behavior that are fulfilled through the use of a specific product or service.
As a subset of life value, user value is directly linked to a particular product or service.
The elements of user value vary depending on the product or service in question.
For example, the user value associated with a mobile phone differs from that of a transport vehicle, and these elements may change over time.
Additionally, user value is dependent on the possession or usage of a product or service.
Product/service value refers to the subjective preference for and evaluation of a product or service in terms of how well it supports a user in achieving their life value.
It includes aspects such as product quality, symbolic meanings attributed by individuals or groups, and market price.
The key distinction between product/service value and user value lies in perspective: product/service value reflects users’ preferences and evaluations of a product or service, whereas user value is the benefit derived from using or purchasing it.
The confusion between these concepts has been amplified by marketing and business research, where they are often grouped under the term customer value.
The relationship between life value, user value, and product/service value is dynamic.
User value elements of a given product or service can influence an individual's life value elements, while life value elements, in turn, shape user value elements.
The concept of user experience refers to all aspects of interactions between a user and a product or service, whereas life experience encompasses everything that happens to an individual, contributing to knowledge, emotions, and skills.
This study is based on two fundamental assumptions:

Value is a multi-dimensional construct – An individual may pursue multiple value elements simultaneously.
The influence of each value element on user behavior depends on context – Situational factors, such as personal circumstances and external conditions, impact how value is perceived and pursued.
Previous research has highlighted the role of context in shaping value.
For instance, human needs may diminish after being satisfied, and situational variables—including physical surroundings, social environments, time constraints, task definitions, and prior conditions—affect behavior.
While understanding these situational influences is important, this study focuses primarily on clarifying user value itself.
Future research may explore the role of personality, attitudes, and situational factors in shaping user value.
Many definitions of consumer value are rooted in the economic paradigm, where value is primarily determined by the monetary sacrifice individuals are willing to make for a product.
This perspective emphasizes the point of exchange, with money serving as a key indicator of value.
The underlying assumption is that, at the moment of purchase, consumers engage in a rational evaluation, weighing the cost against the perceived quality of the product.
However, this approach may be limiting, particularly in the context of design, as it neglects the situation of use.
Studies on consumer value suggest that non-monetary factors also play a crucial role in shaping perceptions of value.
For instance, when assessing fruit beverages, factors such as time and effort required for preparation influence how users perceive product value.
Similarly, in the case of communication products—such as websites—there is often no distinct purchase stage or immediate evaluation of cost versus quality, as seen with physical goods.
Thus, the traditional money-for-product-quality perspective may not fully capture the broader concept of consumer value, particularly for products and services where usability, convenience, and experience play a significant role in shaping user perceptions.
