Here’s an explanation of energy saving impact for a non-expert: When you save energy at home—like turning off lights when you don’t need them, using energy-efficient appliances, or lowering the thermostat—you’re reducing the total amount of energy your household uses. Even though these actions may seem small, they add up, especially when many people in your community do the same. In an energy community, everyone’s efforts to save energy contribute to a shared goal. By using less energy, the community relies less on external sources (like the main power grid), which reduces costs, lowers emissions, and can even make the community more sustainable. When everyone works together to save energy, it reduces the demand on shared resources, making the energy system more efficient and resilient. So, your energy-saving choices at home don’t just benefit you; that helps make a positive impact on the entire community’s energy use.

A Sustainability Champion possesses a clear grasp of actions that positively impact CO2 reduction and pollution control. By understanding the most effective strategies and technologies for reducing carbon emissions and minimizing pollution, a Sustainability Champion is able to implement and advocate for solutions that drive significant environmental change.

Moreover, a Sustainability Champion has a comprehensive understanding of the socio-economic cycle of energy production, distribution, and consumption. This includes knowledge of the various stakeholders involved, from energy producers and suppliers to consumers and regulators. A Sustainability Champion recognizes how these interconnected elements contribute to or hinder sustainability goals.

Additionally, a Sustainability Champion has insight into which players within the energy system are making meaningful contributions to lowering emissions and minimizing pollution. By identifying the organizations, initiatives, or technologies that are leading the way in sustainability, a Sustainability Champion can support and amplify these efforts to accelerate progress toward a greener future.

Here’s a comprehensive explanation for non-experts of the inter-dependency among key stakeholders of energy communities: the energy community involves several key stakeholders, each playing a unique role in fostering a sustainable and resilient energy system. Energy providers supply and distribute electricity, ensuring a stable and reliable flow of energy to meet community needs. They also manage infrastructure like power lines and substations and are increasingly adopting renewable energy sources. Government bodies and regulators create the policy framework that supports the transition to clean energy by setting standards, providing incentives, and implementing regulations that encourage efficiency and the use of renewables. Consumers, or community members, are essential because their choices impact energy demand and sustainability. By conserving energy, using efficient appliances, and generating their own energy (e.g., with solar panels), they help reduce overall demand and emissions. Technology & service providers supply the necessary tools—like solar panels, smart meters, and energy management systems—that make it easier for both consumers and providers to generate, store, and use energy efficiently. Finally, community organizations serve as a bridge, educating and engaging members to build awareness and support for energy-saving initiatives. They foster collaboration among stakeholders and empower individuals to take an active role in the energy transition. Together, these stakeholders contribute to a community’s self-sufficiency, sustainability, and resilience in managing energy resources.

Here’s an explanation of smart home technologies contribution to achieve self-sufficiency tailored for non-experts:

Advanced smart home technology helps an energy community become more self-sufficient by making it easier for individual homes to manage, produce, and store their own energy. Smart devices—like thermostats, appliances, and lighting systems—can be programmed to use energy more efficiently, reducing waste. For example, a smart thermostat can adjust the temperature based on when people are at home, helping save energy when it’s not needed. In addition, smart home technology can integrate with renewable energy sources like solar panels. For instance, a home with solar panels and a battery system can use its own solar energy during the day and store any extra energy for use at night or on cloudy days. Smart technology can also track when the sun is shining the most and automatically run certain appliances during those times, reducing the need to rely on energy from the main grid. By reducing energy waste and using more locally generated renewable energy, advanced smart home systems allow a community to use less power from external sources. This not only lowers electricity bills for everyone involved but also supports the community’s goal of becoming more energy-independent and environmentally friendly. In other words, smart home technology helps each household contribute to a more sustainable, self-sufficient community.

Here a thoroughly explanation on the difference between self-sufficiency and self-consumption for non-experts

Self-Sufficiency: When an energy community aims for “self-sufficiency”, the goal is to generate enough energy locally (typically through renewable sources like solar panels or wind turbines) to meet all or most of its members' energy needs without relying on external energy sources. In this model, the community strives to be as independent as possible from the larger power grid, reducing its dependency on external suppliers. Achieving full self-sufficiency is challenging, especially during times of low renewable generation (e.g., cloudy days or calm weather), so it often requires storage solutions, like batteries, to store surplus energy for later use.

Self-Consumption: In contrast, “self-consumption” focuses on maximizing the use of the energy that the community generates locally, rather than achieving complete independence. Here, the goal is for members to consume as much of their generated energy as possible on-site, reducing the need to export it back to the grid. This approach helps community members make the most of their renewable production, potentially lowering energy bills and improving energy efficiency. Self-consumption strategies can also include demand management, where energy use is timed to match renewable production (like running appliances when the sun is shining for solar energy users).

Key Difference between Self-sufficiency and Self-Consumption: in summary, “self-sufficiency” is about meeting all energy needs independently, aiming for energy independence. “Self-consumption” is about optimizing the use of locally produced energy, without necessarily aiming for full independence from the grid. An energy community may adopt a self-consumption strategy as a step toward greater energy independence but without the pressure of achieving total self-sufficiency.

WIKIPEDIA
Definition of Energy Community: Energy community is a political and legal concept of democratisation, decentralisation of energy/energy services and their collective ownership in the EU. In 2019 European Union adopted "the Clean energy for all Europeans package" to promote and encourage engagement of all its citizens in climate protection and energy transition. The package introduced new (in addition to prosumers) political and legal entities of energy communities, namely: citizen energy community (CEC) and renewable energy community (REC). Each type of energy community was incorporated in a different EU directive.

Renewable energy communities were incorporated already in 2018 in the Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (recast, RED II). REC is a legal entity:

a) which, in accordance with the applicable national law, is based on open and voluntary participation, is autonomous, and is effectively controlled by shareholders or members that are located in the proximity of the renewable energy projects that are owned and developed by that legal entity;

b) the shareholders or members of which are natural persons, SMEs or local authorities, including municipalities;

c) the primary purpose of which is to provide environmental, economic or social community benefits for its shareholders or members or for the local areas where it operates, rather than financial profits.

Energy conservation is the effort to reduce wasteful energy consumption by using fewer energy services. This can be done by using energy more effectively (using less and better sources of energy for continuous service) or changing one's behavior to use less and better source of service (for example, by driving vehicles which consume renewable energy or energy with more efficiency). Energy conservation can be achieved through efficient energy use, which has some advantages, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a smaller carbon footprint, as well as cost, water, and energy savings.

Green engineering practices improve the life cycle of the components of machines which convert energy from one form into another.

Energy can be conserved by reducing waste and losses, improving efficiency through technological upgrades, improving operations and maintenance, changing users' behaviors through user profiling or user activities, monitoring appliances, shifting load to off-peak hours, and providing energy-saving recommendations. Observing appliance usage, establishing an energy usage profile, and revealing energy consumption patterns in circumstances where energy is used poorly, can pinpoint user habits and behaviors in energy consumption. Appliance energy profiling helps identify inefficient appliances with high energy consumption and energy load. Seasonal variations also greatly influence energy load, as more air-conditioning is used in warmer seasons and heating in colder seasons. Achieving a balance between energy load and user comfort is complex yet essential for energy preservation. On a large scale, a few factors affect energy consumption trends, including political issues, technological developments, economic growth, and environmental concerns.

User oriented energy conservation: User behavior has a significant effect on energy conservation. It involves user activity detection, profiling, and appliance interaction behaviors. User profiling consists of the identification of energy usage patterns of the user and replacing required system settings with automated settings that can be initiated on request. Within user profiling, personal characteristics are instrumental in affecting energy conservation behavior. These characteristics include household income, education, gender, age, and social norms. User behavior also relies on the impact of personality traits, social norms, and attitudes on energy conservation behavior. Beliefs and attitudes toward a convenient lifestyle, environmentally friendly transport, energy security, and residential location choices affect energy conservation behavior. As a result, energy conservation can be made possible by adopting pro-environmental behavior and energy-efficient systems. Education on approaches to energy conservation can result in wise energy use. The choices made by the users yield energy usage patterns. Rigorous analysis of these usage patterns identifies waste energy patterns, and improving those patterns may reduce significant energy load. Therefore, human behavior is critical to determining the implications of energy conservation measures and solving environmental problems. Substantial energy conservation may be achieved if users' habit loops are modified.

User habits: User habits significantly impact energy demand; thus, providing recommendations for improving user habits contributes to energy conservation. Micro-moments are essential in realizing energy consumption patterns and are identified using a variety of sensing units positioned in prominent areas across the home. The micro-moment is an event that changes the state of the appliance from inactive to active and helps in building users' energy consumption profiles according to their activities. Energy conservation can be achieved through user habits by following energy-saving recommendations at micro-moments. Unnecessary energy usage can be decreased by selecting a suitable schedule for appliance operation. Creating an effective scheduling system requires an understanding of user habits regarding appliances.

Renewable energy (also called green energy) is energy made from renewable natural resources that are replenished on a human timescale. The most widely used renewable energy types are solar energy, wind power, and hydropower. Bioenergy and geothermal power are also significant in some countries. Some also consider nuclear power a renewable power source, although this is controversial, as nuclear energy requires mining uranium, a nonrenewable resource. Renewable energy installations can be large or small and are suited for both urban and rural areas. Renewable energy is often deployed together with further electrification. This has several benefits: electricity can move heat and vehicles efficiently and is clean at the point of consumption.[1][2] Variable renewable energy sources are those that have a fluctuating nature, such as wind power and solar power. In contrast, controllable renewable energy sources include dammed hydroelectricity, bioenergy, or geothermal power.

Energy conservation measures have primarily focused on technological innovations to improve efficiencies and financial incentives with theoretical explanations obtained from the mentioned analytical traditions. Existing buildings can improve energy efficiency by changing structural maintenance materials, adjusting the composition of air conditioning systems, selecting energy-saving equipment, and formulating subsidy policies. These measures can improve users' thermal comfort and reduce buildings' environmental impact. The selection of combinatorial optimization schemes that contain measures to guide and restrict users' behavior in addition to carrying out demand-side management can dynamically adjust energy consumption. At the same time, economic means should enable users to change their behavior and achieve a low-carbon life. Combination optimization and pricing incentives reduce building energy consumption and carbon emissions and reduce users' costs.

Energy communities: Citizen-driven energy actions that contribute to the clean energy transition, advancing energy efficiency within local communities. Energy communities enable collective and citizen-driven energy actions to support the clean energy transition. They can contribute to increasing public acceptance of renewable energy projects and make it easier to attract private investments in the clean energy transition. Energy communities can be an effective means of re-structuring our energy systems, by empowering citizens to drive the energy transition locally and directly benefit from better energy efficiency, lower bills, reduced energy poverty and more local green job opportunities.

Energy communities allow local communities to join forces and invest in clean energy. Acting as a single entity means energy communities can access all suitable energy markets on a level-playing field with other market actors. Under EU law, energy communities can take the form of any legal entity including an association, a cooperative, a partnership, a non-profit organisation or a limited liability company. 

Clean energy for all Europeans package: The package, adopted in 2019, will help to decarbonise EU’s energy system in line with the European Green Deal objectives.

n 2019 the EU overhauled its energy policy framework to help us move away from fossil fuels towards cleaner energy - and, more specifically, to deliver on the EU’s Paris Agreement commitments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The agreement on this new energy rulebook – called the Clean energy for all Europeans package – marked a significant step towards implementing the energy union strategy, published in 2015.

Based on Commission proposals published in 2016, the package consists of 8 new laws. Following political agreement by the EU Council and the European Parliament (finalised in May 2019) and the entry into force of the different EU rules, EU countries have 1-2 years to convert the new directives into national law.

The new rules will bring considerable benefits for consumers, the environment, and for the economy. By coordinating these changes at EU level, the legislation also underlines EU leadership in tackling global warming and makes an important contribution to the EU’s long-term strategy of achieving carbon neutrality (net-zero emissions) by 2050.

To show global leadership on renewables, the EU has set an ambitious, binding target of 32% for renewable energy sources in the EU’s energy mix by 2030. The revised Renewable Energy Directive (2018/2001/EU), which contains this commitment, entered into force in December 2018.

Skepticism (also spelled scepticism in British English) is a questioning attitude or doubt toward knowledge claims that are seen as mere belief or dogma. For example, if a person is skeptical about claims made by their government about an ongoing war then the person doubts that these claims are accurate. In such cases, skeptics normally recommend not disbelief but suspension of belief, i.e. maintaining a neutral attitude that neither affirms nor denies the claim. This attitude is often motivated by the impression that the available evidence is insufficient to support the claim. Formally, skepticism is a topic of interest in philosophy, particularly epistemology.

As part of the global effort to limit climate change, most countries have committed to net zero greenhouse gas emissions. In practice, this means phasing out fossil fuels and replacing them with low-emissions energy sources. This much needed process, coined as "low-carbon substitutions" in contrast to other transition processes including energy additions, needs to be accelerated multiple times in order to successfully mitigate climate change.[25] At the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference, around three-quarters of the world's countries set a goal of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030. The European Union aims to generate 40% of its electricity from renewables by the same year.






EUROPEAN DOCUMENTS

European consumers are significantly more discerning about a brand’s commitment to sustainability than consumers in other regions, according to new research from brand-valuation consultancy Brand Finance.

Brand Finance’s Global Brand Equity Monitor (GBEM) — which surveyed over 150,000 respondents across 16 European and 24 non-European markets — reveals that European respondents are 25 percent less likely to agree that a brand is committed to environmental sustainability, 26 percent less likely to buy into social sustainability claims, and 22 percent less likely to agree on governance, compared to non-European respondents.

Further analysis shows significant differences within Europe itself. Swiss consumers are the most skeptical — with 23 percent disagreeing that brands are committed to environmental sustainability — followed by consumers in the Netherlands (21 percent), Denmark (20 percent), and Norway (20 percent).

“Brand Finance’s research consistently shows that perceptions of corporate brands vary significantly across regions, with sustainability being a key area where European consumers set a higher standard,” explains Rob Haigh, Strategy & Sustainability Director at Brand Finance. “Sustainability has been a demand driver in Europe for longer than anywhere else; consumer awareness of a range of sustainability issues is high; and Europe continues to lead in sustainability regulations, particularly with the EU’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).

“Sustainability claims must always be genuine and supported by real practices," he added. "But this is particularly true in Europe — where any real or perceived greenwashing is likely to be more rapidly exposed.

Sustainability Perceptions Value: 
- the role of sustainability in driving consumer choice
- which brands consumers believe to be most committed to sustainability
- the proportion of brand value attributable to sustainability perceptions, and the value at risk or to be gained, based on the difference between sustainability perceptions and actual performance.

By addressing these challenges, MASTERPIECE aims to pave the way for a new energy market paradigm, fostering a more sustainable, participatory, and secure energy ecosystem.

SCIENTIFIC PAPERS
One definition of sustainability is essentially meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The Encyclopedia Brittanica defines it thus: “Sustainability [is] the long-term viability of a community, set of social institutions, or societal practice. In general, sustainability is understood as a form of intergenerational ethics in which the environmental and economic actions taken by present persons do not diminish the opportunities of future persons to enjoy similar levels of wealth, utility, or welfare”.

The issue of the understanding of climate change and sustainability touches on many other research issues and questions like the public’s trust in science; attitudes to, and understanding of, risk perception; and the spread of conspiracy theories. Moreover, interest in this area has led to an interest in a number of interesting and important topics, like geo-engineering and transitioning to a green economy, which is well beyond the scope of this review. This means that a wide range of experts from different disciplines have been interested and involved in research in this area, such as those in communication studies, political science, and sociology.

Berg has suggested there are four practice principles in this area. First, nature-related principles aim to decarbonize, reduce the human environmental impact by efficiency, sufficiency, and consistency; be net-positive; prefer local, seasonal, plant-based, and labor-intensive; and espouse the polluter-pays principle and the precautionary principle. Second, personal principles aim to practice contemplation, apply policies with caution, and celebrate frugality. Third, society-related principles grant the least privileged the greatest support; seek mutual understanding and trust; strengthen social cohesion and collaboration; engage stakeholders; and foster education. Fourth, systems-related principles aim to apply systems thinking; foster diversity; be more transparent; and maintain or increase option diversity. This emphasizes the multi-disciplinary approach required by those working in this area.

It is important to recognize that there is a deeply ideological component to the concept of sustainability. There is also the issue of the extent to which people support the essential goals of sustainability as they understand them. Assuming one can assess reliably and validly some, or all, of the features of sustainability, there are inevitable individual differences in the extent to which certain claims are thought to be true. There are also differences in the perceived means and the ends (i.e., how to be sustainable). Many are interested in what motivates people to be sustainability change agents. Equally, there is a vast interest in those who are seen to reject the “message of sustainability”.

The most clear focus of this issue is probably climate change and biodiversity loss. Both of these issues have been heavily politicized: the scientific findings have been challenged and all recommendations for behavioral change have been, and are constantly, debated. In this sense, there are those who reject many of the findings and implications of environmental sustainability.

why people become cynical and skeptical of the messages of many climate scientists. It looks at the research that has attempted to differentiate between different skeptical positions, be it using a dimensional or categorical approach. The major concern of many researchers is to understand how and why people reject certain messages and, therefore, how their views may be changed.

It appears that regardless of how worldviews are measured (e.g., political conservatism or free-market libertarianism), a strong and robust correlation (accounting for up to 50% of the variance) emerges between right-wing political attitudes and CC skepticism.

In the psychological literature, much less interest in socio-political liberalism than conservatism, possibly because many researchers are themselves politically liberal and, thus, do not see it as an issue or problem worthy of investigation. Indeed, just as psychologists study conformity, which interests and puzzles them, sociologists undertake the opposite, namely, investigating deviancy. The psychological literature on socio-economic beliefs seems almost completely devoid of research in terms of measures and theories on socio-political or economic liberalism.

A concept closely linked to sustainability skepticism is that of environmental conservatism. Wilson developed a psychological  and a test of conservatism that has generated significant interest. Wilson suggested that conservative attitudes, as a syndrome, are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors that shape feelings of insecurity and a desire to preserve stability. The common thread of this syndrome is the susceptibility to experience threat or anxiety when faced with uncertainty. Individuals with a conservative outlook on environmental issues often seek to avoid uncertainty both in terms of environmental changes and the responses to them, favoring approaches that emphasize stability, preservation, and caution in the face of ecological challenges.

Energy communities and consumer (co-)ownership in renewable energy (RE) are essential cornerstones of the Energy Transition. When consumers acquire ownership in RE installations, they become prosumers—generating a share of the energy they consume. This not only helps reduce their overall energy expenditure but also provides an additional source of income through the sale of excess production.

Prosumership is expected to be increasingly integrated into energy communities, which involve a broad variety of actors. From a technical perspective, these organizational shifts in energy generation, supply, and management occur within the context of the growing complexity of energy systems. In this paper, we define this evolving landscape as “renewable energy clusters” (RE clusters).

Although both the governance model of energy communities and the engineering model of energy clusters are recognized in practice, comprehensive regulation remains a novelty. Consequently, clear and standardized definitions are still emerging.

Studies on individual values began with an exploration of fundamental human needs. One of the earliest frameworks identified five basic needs: physiological, safety, love, esteem, and self-actualization. Physiological needs are the most fundamental and must be satisfied before an individual seeks higher-level needs. However, this hierarchy is not absolute, as some individuals may prioritize social belonging even when physiological needs remain unmet.

Further research on values at the individual level emphasized their intrinsic importance, independent of external objects or events. Values can be categorized into two main types: terminal values, which represent ideal end states or ultimate life goals, and instrumental values, which define the behaviors and virtues necessary to achieve those goals. While terminal values reflect aspirations for an ideal society or personal fulfillment, instrumental values guide the actions needed to reach those aspirations.

The final perspective on value considers it in monetary terms. Many studies in this area have focused on customer equity through quantitative analyses in marketing. Customer value is often defined as the total discounted lifetime value of all current and potential customers of a firm. This value is typically measured using Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), which represents the net profit a customer generates for a company over their lifetime and can be expressed in monetary terms.

However, the present study aims to explore value as an abstract and complex concept at the individual level, rather than as a measure of financial profit for businesses. While some marketing researchers emphasize value primarily in monetary terms, this study focuses on broader, non-materialistic dimensions of value.

This study defines value by merging various perspectives and addressing the ambiguity of existing definitions. It introduces three key terms: life value, user value, and product/service value.

Life value refers to desirable states of existence or modes of behavior. Desirable states of existence—such as freedom, equality, and salvation—represent ideal future conditions individuals aspire to reach. Modes of behavior—such as self-control, honesty, and generosity—refer to guiding principles that individuals establish for themselves. In this study, the term value is synonymous with life value.

User value is defined as desirable states of existence or modes of behavior that are fulfilled through the use of a specific product or service. As a subset of life value, user value is directly linked to a particular product or service. The elements of user value vary depending on the product or service in question. For example, the user value associated with a mobile phone differs from that of a transport vehicle, and these elements may change over time. Additionally, user value is dependent on the possession or usage of a product or service.

Product/service value refers to the subjective preference for and evaluation of a product or service in terms of how well it supports a user in achieving their life value. It includes aspects such as product quality, symbolic meanings attributed by individuals or groups, and market price. The key distinction between product/service value and user value lies in perspective: product/service value reflects users’ preferences and evaluations of a product or service, whereas user value is the benefit derived from using or purchasing it. The confusion between these concepts has been amplified by marketing and business research, where they are often grouped under the term customer value.

The relationship between life value, user value, and product/service value is dynamic. User value elements of a given product or service can influence an individual's life value elements, while life value elements, in turn, shape user value elements. The concept of user experience refers to all aspects of interactions between a user and a product or service, whereas life experience encompasses everything that happens to an individual, contributing to knowledge, emotions, and skills.

This study is based on two fundamental assumptions:

Value is a multi-dimensional construct – An individual may pursue multiple value elements simultaneously.
The influence of each value element on user behavior depends on context – Situational factors, such as personal circumstances and external conditions, impact how value is perceived and pursued.
Previous research has highlighted the role of context in shaping value. For instance, human needs may diminish after being satisfied, and situational variables—including physical surroundings, social environments, time constraints, task definitions, and prior conditions—affect behavior. While understanding these situational influences is important, this study focuses primarily on clarifying user value itself. Future research may explore the role of personality, attitudes, and situational factors in shaping user value.

Many definitions of consumer value are rooted in the economic paradigm, where value is primarily determined by the monetary sacrifice individuals are willing to make for a product. This perspective emphasizes the point of exchange, with money serving as a key indicator of value. The underlying assumption is that, at the moment of purchase, consumers engage in a rational evaluation, weighing the cost against the perceived quality of the product.

However, this approach may be limiting, particularly in the context of design, as it neglects the situation of use. Studies on consumer value suggest that non-monetary factors also play a crucial role in shaping perceptions of value. For instance, when assessing fruit beverages, factors such as time and effort required for preparation influence how users perceive product value. Similarly, in the case of communication products—such as websites—there is often no distinct purchase stage or immediate evaluation of cost versus quality, as seen with physical goods.

Thus, the traditional money-for-product-quality perspective may not fully capture the broader concept of consumer value, particularly for products and services where usability, convenience, and experience play a significant role in shaping user perceptions.

Knowledge of national and regional policies, as well as community - specific incentives, enables better decision - making and maximizes the advantages offered by the regulative framework.
A Sustainability Champion employ this understanding to navigate and take full reward of these incentives to benefit the community and the environment.
Here ’ s an explanation of vim saving impact for a non - expert: When you save energy at family — like turning off lights when you put on ’ t need them, using energy - efficient appliances, or lowering the thermostat — you ’ re reduce the total amount of energy your household uses.
Even though these actions may seem small, they add up, peculiarly when many people in your community do the like.
In an free energy community, everyone ’ s efforts to save energy contribute to a share goal.
By using less energy, the biotic community relies to a lesser extent on external sources (like the main power grid ), which reduces costs, lower emissions, and can still make the community more sustainable.
When everyone works together to save zip, it reduces the demand on shared resources, making the energy organisation more efficient and resilient.
So, your energy - saving choices at home preceptor ’ t just benefit you; that helps make a electropositive impact on the entire community ’ s energy department use.

Moreover, a Sustainability Champion experience a comprehensive understanding of the socio - economic cycle of vitality production, statistical distribution, and consumption.
This includes cognition of the various stakeholders involved, from energy producers and suppliers to consumer and regulators.
A Sustainability Wiz recognizes how these interconnected component contribute to or hinder sustainability goals.
Additionally, a Sustainability Champion has insight into which players within the energy system are gain meaningful contributions to lowering emanation and minimizing pollution.
By identifying the organizations, initiatives, or technologies that are head the way in sustainability, a Sustainability Star can support and amplify these efforts to accelerate progress toward a greener future.
Here ’ s a comprehensive explanation for non - expert of the inter - dependency among key stakeholders of energy communities: the energy community involves several key stakeholders, each playing a unparalleled role in fostering a sustainable and resilient energy arrangement.
Energy providers supply and distribute electrical energy, ensuring a static and reliable flow of energy to meet community demand.
They likewise manage infrastructure like power lines and substations and are increasingly adopting renewable energy sources.
Government bodies and regulators create the policy framework that tolerate the transition to clean vigour by setting standards, bring home the bacon incentives, and implementing regulations that encourage efficiency and the use of renewables.
Consumer, or residential district members, are essential because their choices impact energy demand and sustainability.
By conserving energy, using effective appliances, and generating their own energy (e. g. , with solar panel ), they help reduce overall demand and emissions.
Technology & service providers supply the necessary tools — like solar dialog box, smart meters, and energy direction systems — that make it easier for both consumer and provider to generate, store, and use energy efficiently.
Finally, community organizations serve as a bridge, educating and engaging members to make awareness and living for energy - saving go ahead.
They nurture collaboration among stakeholders and empower individuals to take an active role in the energy modulation.
Together, these stakeholders contribute to a community ’ s self - sufficiency, sustainability, and resilience in managing vigour resource.
Here ’ s an account of smart house technologies contribution to achieve self - sufficiency tailored for non - experts: Advanced hurt home technology helps an energy community become more self - sufficient by making it easygoing for individual homes to superintend, produce, and store their own energy.
Smart devices — like thermostats, appliances, and light systems — can be programmed to use vim more efficiently, reducing thriftlessness.
For example, a smart thermostat can adjust the temperature based on when people are at home, helping relieve doe when it ’ s not want.
In addition, smart home technology can integrate with renewable energy rootage similar solar panels.
For instance, a family with solar panels and a battery system bathroom use its own solar energy during the day and store any extra energy for use at night or on cloudy days.
Smart technology can also track when the sun is shining the most and automatically run certain gizmo during those times, slenderize the need to rely on vitality from the main grid.
By reducing energy waste and using more topically generated renewable energy, advanced smart home systems allow a community to apply less power from external sources.
This not only lowers electricity bills for everyone involved but besides supports the community ’ s goal of get more energy - independent and environmentally friendly.
In other words, saucy home technology helps each household contribute to a more sustainable, self - sufficient community.
Here a thoroughly explanation on the difference between self - adequacy and ego - consumption for non - expert Self - Sufficiency: When an energy community direct for “ self - sufficiency ”, the finish is to generate enough energy locally (typically through with renewable source like solar panels or wind turbines) to meet all or most of its members ' energy needs without relying on external energy sources.
In this example, the biotic community strives to be every bit independent as possible from the larger power grid, reducing its dependency on external suppliers.
Achieving full self - sufficiency is challenging, especially during times of low renewable generation (e. g. , cloudy days operating theatre calm weather ), so information technology much requires storage resolution, like batteries, to store surplus energy for late use.
Self - Consumption: In contrast, “ self - consumption ” focalize on maximizing the use of the energy that the residential area generates locally, sooner than achieving pure independence.
Here, the goal is for members to consume as much of their generated energy as possible on - website, reducing the need to export it back to the grid.
This approach helps community members make the most of their renewable product, potentially lowering energy bills and improving energy efficiency.
Self - consumption strategies buns also include requirement management, where energy use is timed to match renewable production (like running appliances when the dominicus is shining for solar energy users ).
Key Difference between Ego - sufficiency and Self - Consumption: in summary, “ ego - sufficiency ” is about meeting all doe needs independently, aiming for energy independency.
“ Self - consumption ” is astir optimizing the use of locally produced energy, without necessarily aiming for full independence from the gridiron.
An energy community may adopt a self - consumption strategy as a step toward greater energy independency but without the pressure of attain total self - sufficiency.

Here ' s an explanation in English of the values that might resonate with such an individual: Environmental Stewardship: The user prioritise protecting natural resources, reducing permissive waste, and minimizing their carbon footmark.
They may support renewable energy, eco - friendly products, and sustainable agricultural practices, believing that responsible for management of the World is crucial for future generations.
Social Equity: Sustainability isn ' t just astir the environment; it ' s also about fair treatment and equal opportunities for all.
A sustainability - focused individual often values societal justice, advocating for practice session that help reduce inequality and support marginalized communities, especially those disproportionately affected by environmental degradation.
Conservation and Biodiversity: Preserve ecosystem, species, and genetic diversity is fundamental to their values.
They support actions that aim to protect forests, oceans, wildlife, and endangered species, understanding that biodiversity is key to maintain balance in nature.
Rotary Saving: A belief in the grandness of reducing, reusing, and recycling.
The user may choose buying 2d - hand, supporting upcycling, or investing in companies that promote product longevity, sort of than the traditional linear model of " take, make, dispose. "
Holistic Well - being: They view sustainability as not only an environmental issue but a lifestyle that encompasses health, well - comprise, and biotic community.
This includes support clean air and water, organic and local food, and eco - friendly transportation options, which contribute to better quality of life for both individual and society.
Ethical Consumerism: This value require making purchasing decisions that align with sustainability goals, such as choosing products made with ethical labor practices, bonny trade, and minimal environmental harm.
Innovation for Sustainability: They may value technological and societal innovation that contributes to sustainable practices, such as advancements in clean energy, green architecture, and sustainable agriculture, believing that innovation can lick many of the world ' s environmental challenge.
a sustainability - loving user holds values that prioritise the long - full term health of the planet, people, and future generations, seeing sustainability as an interconnected, multifaceted access to solving global issues.
WIKIPEDIA Definition of Energy Community: Energy residential district be a political and sound concept of democratisation, decentralisation of energy / energy services and their collective ownership in the EU.
In 2019 European Union adopted " the Clean energy for all Europeans package " to promote and encourage engagement of all its citizens in mood protection and energy transition.
The package introduced new (in addition to prosumers) political and legal entities of energy communities, namely: citizen energy community (CEC) and renewable vim community (REC ).
Each type of energy community comprise incorporate in a different EU directive.
Renewable energy communities were incorporated already in 2018 in the Directive on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources (recast, marxist II ).
REC is a effectual entity: a) which, in accordance with the applicable national law, be based on open and voluntary participation, is autonomous, and is effectively controlled by shareholders or members that are located in the proximity of the renewable energy projects that are owned and developed by that legal entity; b) the stockholder or members of which are natural persons, SMEs or local authorities, including municipality; hundred) the primary purpose of which be to provide environmental, economic or societal community benefits for its shareholders or members or for the local areas where it operates, kind of than financial profits.
Energy conservation is the effort to reduce wasteful doe consumption by use few energy services.
This can be done by using energy more effectively (using less and better sources of energy for continuous service) or changing unrivaled ' s conduct to use less and better source of service (for model, by driving vehicles which consume renewable department of energy or energy with more efficiency ).
Vigor conservation can be achieve through efficient energy use, which has some advantages, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a minor carbon footprint, as easily as cost, water, and energy savings.
Green engineering practices improve the life cycle of the components of machine which convert vigour from one form into another.
Energy can be conserved by reducing waste and losses, ameliorate efficiency through technological upgrades, improving mental process and care, vary users ' behaviors through user profiling or user activities, monitoring appliances, shifting load to off - apex hours, and providing energy - saving recommendations.
Observing appliance usage, establishing an energy usage profile, and bring out energy consumption patterns in circumstances where energy is used poorly, can pinpoint user habits and behaviors in push consumption.
Appliance energy profile serve identify inefficient appliances with high energy consumption and energy load.
Seasonal variations also greatly influence energy load, as more air - conditioning is used in warm seasons and heating in colder seasons.
Achieving a balance between energy freight and user solace is complex yet essential for energy saving.
On a large exfoliation, a few factors affect energy consumption movement, including political issues, technological developments, economic growth, and environmental concerns.
User oriented push conservation: User behavior has a substantial effect on energy conservation.
It involves user activity spying, profiling, and appliance interaction behaviour.
User profiling consists of the identification of energy usage traffic pattern of the user and replacing required organisation settings with automated settings that can be initiated on request.
Within user profiling, personal characteristics equal instrumental in affecting energy conservation behavior.
These characteristics include household income, education, grammatical gender, historic period, and societal norms.
User behavior also relies on the impact of personality traits, social average, and attitudes on energy conservation behavior.
Beliefs and attitudes toward a convenient lifestyle, environmentally friendly tape drive, energy security, and residential location choices affect energy conservation behaviour.
As a result, doe conservation can be made possible by adopting pro - environmental behavior and energy - efficient systems.
Education on approaches to energy conservation can result in wise energy economic consumption.
The choices made by the users give energy usage pattern.
Rigorous analysis of these usage patterns identifies waste energy patterns, and meliorate those figure may reduce significant energy load.
Thus, human behavior is critical to determining the implications of energy preservation measures and solving environmental problems.
Substantial vim conservation may be achieved if user ' use loops are modified.
Substance abuser habits: User habit significantly impact energy demand; thus, providing good word for improving user habits contributes to energy conservation.
Micro - second are essential in realizing energy consumption patterns and are identified using a variety of sensing units positioned in prominent sphere across the home.
The micro - moment is an event that changes the state of the appliance from inactive to combat ready and helps in building users ' energy consumption profile according to their activities.
Energy preservation can be achieved through user habits by following energy - salve passport at micro - moments.
Unnecessary energy usage can be decreased by selecting a desirable schedule for appliance operation.
Creating an effective programing system demand an understanding of user habits regarding appliances.
Renewable energy (also called green vigor) is energy made from renewable natural resources that be replenished on a human timescale.
The most widely used renewable energy types are solar vim, wind power, and hydropower.
Bioenergy and geothermic power are also meaning in some countries.
Some also consider atomic power a renewable great power source, although this is controversial, as nuclear energy requires mining atomic number 92, a nonrenewable resource.
Renewable energy installations can be large or small and are suited for both urban and rural area.
Renewable energy is often deployed in concert with further electrification.
This has several benefits: electricity john move rut and vehicles efficiently and is clean at the point of consumption.
[ 1] [2] Variable renewable energy informant personify those that have a fluctuating nature, such as wind power and solar power.
In contrast, controllable renewable energy sources include dammed hydroelectricity, bioenergy, or geothermic power.
Energy conservation measures have primarily focused on technological innovations to improve efficiencies and fiscal incentives with theoretical explanations obtained from the mentioned analytical traditions.
Existing buildings can improve vigor efficiency by changing structural maintenance materials, adjusting the composition of air conditioning systems, take energy - saving equipment, and formulating subsidy policies.
These criterion can ameliorate users ' thermal comfort and reduce buildings ' environmental impact.
The extract of combinatorial optimization schemes that contain bill to guide and restrict users ' behavior in addition to carry out demand - side management can dynamically adjust vigor consumption.
At the same time, economical means should enable users to change their doings and achieve a low - carbon life.
Compounding optimization and pricing incentives reduce building energy consumption and carbon emission and reduce users ' price.
Energy communities: Citizen - driven zip action that contribute to the clean energy transition, advance energy efficiency within local communities.
Energy community enable collective and citizen - driven energy actions to support the clean energy transition.
They can contribute to increasing public acceptance of renewable energy projects and make it easier to attract private investments in the clean zip transition.
Energy communities can be an effective means of re - structure our energy systems, by empower citizens to drive the energy transition locally and flat benefit from better energy efficiency, lower bills, reduced energy poverty and more local green problem opportunities.
Vigour communities allow local community to join forces and invest in clean energy.
Acting as a unmarried entity means energy communities can access all suitable energy market place on a level - playing field with other market actors.
Under EU law, energy community of interests can take the pattern of any legal entity including an connexion, a cooperative, a partnership, a non - net income organisation or a limited liability company.
Clean energy for all Europeans package: The package, adopted in 2019, will help to decarbonise EU ’ s energy organisation in line with the European Green Mess objectives.
n 2019 the EU overhauled its energy policy framework to help us move away from fossil fuels towards cleaner energy - and, more specifically, to deliver on the EU ’ s Paris Correspondence commitments for deoxidise greenhouse gas emissions.
The agreement on this newfangled vigour rulebook – call the Clean energy for all Europeans package – marked a significant step towards implementing the energy north strategy, published in 2015.
Base on Perpetration proposal of marriage published in 2016, the package consists of 8 new laws.
Following political agreement by the EU Council and the European Parliament (finalised in May 2019) and the entrance into force of the different european union rules, EU countries have 1 - 2 year to convert the new directives into national law.
The new rules will bring considerable benefit for consumer, the surroundings, and for the economy.
By coordinating these changes at EU level, the legislation also underlines EU leaders in tackling global warming and makes an important contribution to the EU ’ s long - term strategy of accomplish carbon neutrality (net - zero emissions) by 2050.
To show global leadership on renewables, the EU has set an ambitious, binding target of 32% for renewable vitality sources in the EU ’ s energy mix by 2030.
The revised Renewable Energy Directive (2018 / 2001 / EU ), which contains this commitment, infix into force in December 2018.
Skepticism (also spelled scepticism in British English) is a questioning position or doubt toward cognition claims that are experience as mere belief or dogma.
For example, if a person is skeptical astir claims made by their government about an ongoing war then the person doubts that these claims are accurate.
In such cases, skeptics usually recommend not disbelief but break of belief, i. e.
maintaining a neutral attitude that neither affirms nor abnegate the title.
This attitude be often motivated by the depression that the available evidence is deficient to support the claim.
Formally, skepticism follow a topic of interest in doctrine, particularly epistemology.
As part of the global movement to limit climate modification, most countries have committed to net zero greenhouse natural gas emissions.
In practice, this means phasing out fossil fuel and replacing them with low - emissions energy beginning.
This much needed process, coined as " low - carbon substitutions " in contrast to other transition processes admit energy additions, needs to be accelerated multiple times in order to successfully mitigate climate change.
[ xxv] At the 2023 United Nations Mood Change Conference, around three - quarters of the world ' s countries set a goal of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030.
The European Uniting aims to generate 40% of its electricity from renewables by the same class.
EUROPEAN DOCUMENTS European consumers are significantly to a greater extent distinguish about a brand ’ s commitment to sustainability than consumers in other regions, according to new research from brand - valuation consultancy Brand Finance.
Brand Finance ’ s Global Brand Equity Monitor (GBEM) — which surveyed over 150, 000 respondents across 16 European and 24 non - European markets — reveals that European respondents are 25 percent less likely to agree that a brand is committed to environmental sustainability, 26 percent less likely to buy into social sustainability title, and 22 percent less likely to agree on governance, compared to non - European respondents.
Farther depth psychology show significant differences within Europe itself.
Swiss consumer are the most skeptical — with 23 percent disagreeing that brands are commit to environmental sustainability — follow by consumers in the Netherlands (21 percent ), Denmark (20 percent ), and Norway (20 percent ).
“ Brand Finance ’ s research consistently shows that perceptions of corporate blade variegate significantly across regions, with sustainability being a key area where European consumers set a higher measure, ” explains Rob Haigh, Strategy & Sustainability Director at Brand Finance.
“ Sustainability has been a demand driver in Eu for longer than anywhere else; consumer consciousness of a compass of sustainability issues is in high spirits; and Europe continues to lead in sustainability regulations, particularly with the EU ’ s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD ).
“ Sustainability claims must always be genuine and supported by material practices, " atomic number 2 added.
" Only this is particularly true in Eec — where any real or perceived greenwashing is likely to be more rapidly exposed.
Sustainability Perceptions Value: - the role of sustainability in driving consumer choice - which denounce consumers believe to be most committed to sustainability - the balance of brand value attributable to sustainability perception, and the value at risk operating room to be gained, based on the difference between sustainability perceptions and actual performance.
MASTERPIECE: Advancing Energy Communities in Europe MASTERPIECE is a digital coordination and cooperation platform designed to help the world and operation of energy communities across Europe.

SCIENTIFIC PAPERS One definition of sustainability is essentially meeting the needs of the present without compromise the power of future generations to meet their own needs.
The Encyclopedia Brittanica defines information technology thus: “ Sustainability [be] the foresightful - term viability of a community, set of social institutions, or societal practice.
In general, sustainability is understood as a form of intergenerational ethics in which the environmental and economical actions taken by present persons do not diminish the opportunities of future persons to enjoy standardized levels of wealth, utility, or welfare ”.
The subject of the understanding of climate change and sustainability touches on many other research issues and question like the public ’ s trust in scientific discipline; attitudes to, and understanding of, risk perception; and the spread of conspiracy theories.
Moreover, pastime in this area have precede to an interest in a number of interesting and important topics, like geo - technology and transitioning to a green economy, which is well beyond the scope of this review.
This means that a wide range of experts from different disciplines have exist interested and call for in research in this area, such as those in communication studies, political science, and sociology.
Berg has suggested in that location are four practice rule in this area.
First, nature - related to principles aim to decarbonize, reduce the human environmental impact by efficiency, sufficiency, and consistency; follow net - positive; prefer local, seasonal, plant - based, and labor - intensive; and espouse the defiler - pays principle and the precautionary principle.
Second, personal rule aim to practice contemplation, give policies with caution, and celebrate frugality.
Third, society - related principles grant the least privileged the greatest supporting; seek mutual understanding and trust; tone social cohesion and quislingism; engage stakeholders; and foster education.
Fourth, systems - related principles aim to apply systems thinking; foster diversity; be more see through; and maintain or increase selection diverseness.
This accent the multi - disciplinary approach required by those working in this area.
It is important to recognize that at that place is a deeply ideological component to the construct of sustainability.
There is also the issue of the extent to which people support the essential goals of sustainability as they infer them.
Assume unmatchable can assess reliably and validly some, or all, of the feature article of sustainability, there are inevitable individual differences in the extent to which certain claims are thought to be true.
There are also differences in the perceived substance and the ends (i. e. , how to follow sustainable ).
Many cost interested in what motivates people to be sustainability modification agents.
As, there is a vast interest in those who are seen to reject the “ message of sustainability ”.
The nigh clear focus of this issue is probably climate change and biodiversity going.
Both of these issues own be heavily politicized: the scientific findings have been challenged and all recommendations for behavioral change have be, and are constantly, debated.
In this sensation, there are those who turn away many of the findings and implications of environmental sustainability.
wherefore people become cynical and skeptical of the messages of many climate scientists.
It looks at the research that has attempted to distinguish between different unbelieving positions, be it using a dimensional or categorical approach.
The major concern of many researcher is to understand how and why people reject certain messages and, therefore, how their views may be changed.
It appears that regardless of how worldviews are measured (e. g. , political conservatism beaver state free - market libertarianism ), a strong and robust correlation (accounting for up to 50% of the variance) emerges between right - wing political attitudes and cubic centimeter skepticism.
In the psychological literature, much less interest in socio - political liberalism than conservatism, possibly because many researchers are themselves politically bounteous and, thus, suffice not see it as an issue or problem worthy of investigation.
Indeed, just as psychologists study conformity, which interests and mystifier them, sociologists undertake the opposite word, to wit, investigating deviancy.
The psychological literature on socio - economic beliefs seem almost completely devoid of research in terms of measures and theories on socio - political or economic liberalism.
A concept closely join to sustainability skepticism is that of environmental conservativism.
Wilson developed a psychological and a run of conservatism that has bring forth significant interestingness.
Wilson suggested that conservative attitudes, as a syndrome, are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors that form feelings of insecurity and a desire to preserve stability.
The common thread of this syndrome is the susceptibleness to experience threat or anxiety when faced with uncertainty.
Person with a cautious outlook on environmental issues often seek to avoid uncertainty both in term of environmental changes and the responses to them, favoring plan of attack that emphasize stability, preservation, and caution in the face of ecological challenges.
Push communities and consumer (co -) ownership in renewable energy (RE) are essential cornerstones of the Energy Transition.
When consumers acquire ownership in RE installation, they become prosumers — generating a share of the energy they consume.
This not only helps reduce their overall energy expenditure but also provides an additional germ of income through the sales event of excess output.
Prosumership is look to be increasingly integrated into vim communities, which involve a broad variety of actors.
From a technical perspective, these organizational chemise in department of energy generation, supply, and management occur within the context of the growing complexity of energy systems.
In this paper, we limit this evolving landscape as “ renewable vitality clusters ” (RE clusters ).
Although both the governance model of energy communities and the engineering model of vigour clusters are recognized in practice, comprehensive regulation remains a novelty.
Consequently, percipient and standardized definitions personify still go forth.
Study on individual values commence with an exploration of fundamental human need.
One of the earliest frameworks identified five basic penury: physiological, safety, love, regard as, and self - realization.
Physiological needs are the most fundamental and must be satisfied before an individual seek gamey - level needs.
However, this power structure is not right down, as some individuals may prioritize societal belonging even when physiological needs remain unmet.
Farther research on values at the individual degree emphasized their intrinsic importance, independent of external objective or events.
Time value can be categorized into two main types: terminal value, which be ideal end states or ultimate life goals, and instrumental values, which define the behaviors and virtues necessary to achieve those goals.
While terminal values mull aspirations for an ideal society or personal fulfilment, instrumental values direct the actions needed to reach those aspirations.
The final perspective on value considers it in monetary term.
Many studies in this area cause focused on customer equity through quantitative analysis in marketing.
Customer value be often defined as the total discounted lifetime value of all current and potential customers of a firm.
This value is typically measured using Customer Lifetime Value (CLV ), which represents the final profit a customer sire for a company over their lifetime and can constitute expressed in monetary terms.
However, the present study aims to explore value as an abstract and complex construct at the individual level, rather than as a measure of financial profit for businesses.
While some marketing researcher emphasize note value primarily in monetary terms, this study focuses on broader, non - materialistic dimensions of note value.
This study defines value by merging various perspectives and addressing the ambiguity of existing definition.
Information technology introduces three key terms: life value, user value, and product / inspection and repair note value.
Life value refers to desirable states of creation or musical mode of behavior.
Desirable states of existence — such as freedom, equation, and salvation — represent idealistic future conditions individuals aspire to reach.
Modes of behavior — such as self - ascendence, honesty, and generosity — refer to guide principles that individuals establish for themselves.
In this study, the term note value is synonymous with biography time value.
Exploiter value be defined as desirable states of existence or modes of behavior that are fulfilled through the use of a specific merchandise or service.
As a subset of life value, user value is straightaway linked to a particular product or religious service.
The elements of user value vary depending on the product or inspection and repair in doubtfulness.
For example, the drug user value associated with a fluid phone differs from that of a transport vehicle, and these elements may change terminated time.
Additionally, user value be dependent on the possession or usage of a product or service.
Product / service value refers to the subjective predilection for and evaluation of a cartesian product or service in terms of how substantially it supports a user in achieving their life value.
It includes aspects such as product quality, symbolic meaning attribute by individuals or groups, and market price.
The key distinction between product / divine service value and user value lies in perspective: product / service value reflects users ’ preferences and evaluations of a product beaver state service, whereas user value is the benefit gain from using or purchasing it.
The confusion between these concepts has been amplified by marketing and business research, where they are often grouped under the term client economic value.
The relationship between life value, user value, and mathematical product / service value cost active.
Drug user value element of a given product or service can influence an individual ' s life time value elements, while life value elements, in act, shape user value elements.
The concept of user experience refers to all aspects of interactions between a user and a product or service, whereas life experience encompasses everything that happens to an individual, contributing to knowledge, emotions, and skills.
This study is based on two fundamental assumptions: Note value be a multi - dimensional construct – An individual may pursue multiple value elements at the same time.
The influence of each value component on user behavior depends on context – Situational factors, such as personal circumstances and external conditions, impact how value is perceived and pursued.
Old inquiry has highlighted the role of context in shaping value.
For instance, human needs may lessen after being satisfied, and situational variables — let in physical surroundings, social environments, time constraints, task definitions, and prior conditions — affect deportment.
While understanding these situational influences is important, this study focuses primarily on clarify user time value itself.
Future research may research the office of personality, attitudes, and situational factors in mould user value.
Many definitions of consumer economic value are rooted in the economic epitome, where value is primarily determined by the monetary sacrifice individuals are willing to make for a product.
This position emphasizes the point of central, with money serving as a key indicator of value.
The underlying assumption is that, at the moment of leverage, consumers engage in a rational evaluation, weighing the cost against the perceived quality of the product.
However, this approach may be limiting, particularly in the setting of design, as it overleap the situation of economic consumption.
Studies on consumer value suggest that non - monetary factors besides recreate a all important role in shaping perceptions of value.
For instance, when assessing fruit drink, factors such as time and exploit required for preparation influence how users perceive product value.
Similarly, in the eccentric of communication products — such as site — there is often no distinct leverage leg or immediate evaluation of cost versus quality, as seen with physical goods.
Thus, the traditional money - for - mathematical product - quality perspective whitethorn not fully entrance the broader concept of consumer value, particularly for products and services where usability, convenience, and experience play a significant role in shaping user perceptions.

In addition, a Sustainability Champion has insight into which players within the energy system are making meaningful contributions to lowering emissions and minimizing pollution. By identifying the organizations, initiatives, or technologies that are leading the way in sustainability, a Sustainability Champion can support and amplify these efforts to accelerate progress toward a greener future.

As the energy sustainability community, each key stakeholders is required to provide the energy necessary to meet community needs. Energy providers supply and distribute power and power and their utility manage power lines and substations and are now increasingly adopting renewable energy sources. Consumers, or community members, are essential because their choices impact energy demand and sustainability.

How does the smart home technology contribute to self-sufficiency?

Intelligent home technology, like heat pump or Wi-Fi, can be programmed to use energy more efficiently, reducing waste. For example, a Smart Home thermostat can adjust the temperature based on when people are at home, helping save energy when it’s not needed. Smart Home technology can integrate with renewable energy such as solar panels, lights, and sensors.

Here a thoroughly explanation on the difference between self-sufficiency and self-consumption for non-experts.

When an energy community aims for self-sufficiency, the goal is to generate enough energy locally (typically through renewable sources like solar panels or wind turbines) to meet all or most of its members' energy needs without relying on external energy sources. In this model, the community strives to be as independent as possible from the larger power grid, reducing its dependency on external suppliers. Achieving full self-sufficiency is challenging, especially during times of low renewable generation (e.g., cloudy days

Self-Consumption: In contrast, “self-consumption” focuses on maximizing the use of energy that the community generates locally, rather than achieving complete independence. Here, the goal is for members to consume as much of their generated energy as possible on-site, reducing the need to export it back to the grid. Self-consumption strategies can also include demand management, where energy use is timed to match renewable production (like running appliances when the sun is shining for solar energy users).

How can we meet our electricity needs independently without the pressure of total self-sufficiency?

The skeptical Domain Knowledge: How is it analyzed in context?

- Familiar with fossil fuel-based energy systems and infrastructures and infrastructure to manage these issues on a macro level.

- Limited understanding of renewable energy technologies, their costs, and environmental impacts. -

Is it possible to transition to a green economy soon?

Lacks basic knowledge of climate change and sustainability principles.

The skeptical individual prioritizes cost-saving and economic efficiency over environmental considerations. For them, the primary focus is on financial practicality, often viewing environmental initiatives as secondary to the immediate goal of maximizing profits and minimizing expenses. They tend to favor solutions that offer clear economic benefits, regardless of their environmental impact.

The skeptical individual distrusts governments regulations and interventions in the energy market. They believe that government actions often create unnecessary bureaucracy, increase costs, and limit market competition. This skepticism extends to policies and incentives that aim to promote sustainability, as they view them as potentially restrictive and economically inefficient.

For these individuals, the transition to renewable energy may seem premature or unrealistic. These individuals also question the reliability, scalability, and cost-effectiveness of renewable energy solutions, often believing that these technologies are still too unproven or costly to replace traditional energy sources.

As an individual skeptical towards renewable energy, they argue fossil energy is required and needed for a stable economy. They view attempts to phase them out as unrealistic or harmful to economic growth.

The skeptical individual is familiar with fossil fuel-based energy systems and infrastructure. They have a deep understanding of the traditional energy landscape, including the mechanisms of coal, oil, and natural gas production, distribution, and consumption. This familiarity leads them to believe that these systems are reliable and well-established, making them hesitant to embrace newer energy solutions.

I'm a first-time PV engineer. I have no idea if renewable energy is really that efficient, and whether they work in any way and in what ways. Also, it seems that I need a resource for this. As they are preparing their energy management plans, I have given them few opportunities. On the other hand, I know I don't have a simple energy plan that has all these features. I have some knowledge about how to achieve this.

The skeptical individual doubts the feasibility and scalability of transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewable energy on a large scale. They believe that shifting away from fossil fuels would be costly, disruptive, and difficult to achieve. They may argue that the infrastructure and technology required for such a transition are not yet ready or economically viable.

Secondly, the skeptical individual lacks in-depth knowledge of climate change science and sustainability principles. While they may be aware of basic environmental issues, they may not fully understand the scientific consensus on climate change or the urgency of adopting sustainable practices. This lack of detailed knowledge makes them less inclined to support policies or technologies aimed at mitigating environmental impact.

WIKIPEDIA / WIKIPEDIA Sr.lam:

Definition of Energy Community: Energy community is a political and legal concept of democratisation, decentralisation of energy/energy services and their collective ownership in the EU. In 2019 European Union adopted "The Clean Energy for All Europeans package" to promote and encourage engagement of all its citizens in climate protection and energy transition. The package introduced new (besides prosumers) political and legal entities of energy communities, namely: citizen energy community (CEC) and renewable energy community (REC).

Renewable energy communities were incorporated already in 2018 in the Directive on the promotion of the use of renewable resources (recast, RED II). REC is a legal entity: if the market was fully polluted by renewable energy units, renewable energy communities would be disproportionately affected...

c) which, in accordance with the applicable national law, is based on open and voluntary participation, is autonomous, and is effectively controlled by shareholders or members that are located in proximity of renewable energy projects that are owned and developed by that legal entity;

b) the shareholders or members of which are natural persons, SMEs or local authorities, including municipalities; having subsidiaries:

c) the purpose of which is to provide environmental, economic or social community benefits for its shareholders or members or for the local areas where it operates, rather than financial profits.

Energy conservation is the effort to reduce wasteful energy consumption by using fewer energy services. This can be done by using energy more effectively (using less and better sources of energy for continuous service) or changing one's behavior to use less and better source of service (for example, by driving vehicles which consume renewable energy or energy with more efficiency). Energy conservation can be achieved through efficient energy use, which has some advantages, including a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and a smaller carbon footprint, as well as cost, water and energy savings.

Green engineering practices improve the life cycle of the components of machines which convert energy from one form to another.

Energy uses can be determined by identifying energy consumption and spending patterns, establishing a data usage profile, and revealing energy use patterns in circumstances where energy is used poorly. On a large scale, a few factors affect energy consumption trends, including political issues, technological developments, economic growth, and environmental concerns.

Do people have energy conservation rights? Why or why not?

Determination of energy consumption can be achieved by providing recommendations for improving user habits contributes to energy conservation. Micro-moments are essential in realizing energy consumption patterns and are identified using a variety of sensing units positioned in prominent areas across the home. The micro-moment is an event that changes the state of the appliance from inactive to active and helps in building user's energy consumption profiles according to their activities. Unnecessary energy usage can be decreased by selecting a suitable scheduling system.

Renewable energy, or green energy, are relatively new technologies. Most large renewable energy projects use renewable sources of energy. The major single sources of renewable power are wind and solar power.

Energy conservation measures have primarily focused on technological innovations to improve efficiencies and financial incentives with theoretical explanations obtained from the mentioned analytical traditions. Existing buildings can improve energy efficiency by changing structural maintenance materials, adjusting the composition of air conditioning systems, and selecting energy-saving equipment. These measures can improve users' thermal comfort and reduce building's environmental impact. The selection of combinatorial optimization schemes that contain measures to guide and restrict users' behavior in addition to carrying out demand side management can dynamically adjust energy consumption.

Energy communities: Citizen-driven energy actions that contribute to the clean energy transition, advancing energy efficiency within local communities. Energy communities enable collective and citizen-driven energy actions to support the clean energy transition. They can contribute to increasing public acceptance of renewable energy projects and make it easier to attract private investments in the clean energy transition. Energy communities can be an effective means of re-structuring our energy systems, by empowering citizens to drive the energy transition locally and directly benefit from better energy efficiency, lower bills, reduced energy poverty and more local green job

Energy communities allow local communities to join forces and invest in clean energy. Acting as a single entity means energy communities can access all suitable energy markets on a level playing field with other market actors. Under EU law, energy communities can take the form of any legal entity including an association, a cooperative, a partnership, a non-profit organisation or a private company.

Clean Energy for All Europe: The package, adopted in 2019, will help to decarbonise EU’s energy system in line with the European Green Deal objectives.

The UK and the EU have withdrawn their energy cooperation agreements and merged their efforts to accelerate their transition from fossil fuels to cleaner fuels. In 2019, the EU will consider turning to renewable energy if the Paris Agreement is not delivered on its commitments.

The introduction of a new energy rulebook, the Clean Energy for all Europeans (Clean energy for all Europeans) has marked a significant step towards implementing the energy union strategy, published in 2015. It will provide a clear picture of the environment and environment for all of Europe.

Based on the Commission proposals published in 2016, the package consists of 8 new laws. Following political agreement by the EU Council and the European Parliament (finalised in May 2019) and the entry into force of the different EU rules, EU countries have 1-2 years to convert the new directives into national laws.

The new rules will bring substantial benefits for consumers, the environment, and for the economy. By coordinating these changes at EU level, the legislation also underlines EU leadership in tackling global warming and makes an important contribution to the EU's long term strategy of achieving carbon neutrality (net-zero emissions) by 2050.

As a leader for renewables, the European Parliament has set a target of 32% of renewable energy sources in the EU’s energy mix by 2030. The revised renewable energy Directive (2018/2001/EU), which contains this commitment, entered into force in December 2018.

Skepticism is a doubt attitude (or questioning attitude) concerning knowledge claims that are seen as mere belief. For example, if a person is skeptical about claims made by their government about an ongoing war then the person doubts that these claims are accurate. In such cases, skeptics normally recommend not disbelief but suspension of belief, i.e. maintaining a neutral attitude that neither affirms nor denies the claim. This attitude is often motivated by the impression that the available evidence is insufficient to support

As part of the global effort to limit climate change, most countries have committed to net zero greenhouse gas emissions. In practice, this means phasing out fossil fuels and replacing them with low-emissions energy sources. This much needed process, coined as "low-carbon substitutions", needs to be accelerated multiple times in order to mitigate climate change.

EUROPE - DOCUMENTS TOGETHER ADOPTIVES, ORCHESTICS, KNOWLEDGE AND CONFORMITY

European consumers are significantly more discerning about a brand’s commitment to sustainability than consumers in other regions, according to new research from brand-valuation consultancy Brand Finance.

Brand Finance Global Brand Equity Monitor (GBEM) — which surveyed over 150,000 respondents across 16 European and 24 non-European markets — reveals that European respondents are 25 percent less likely to agree that a brand is committed to environmental sustainability, 26 percent less likely to buy into social sustainability claims, and 22 percent less likely to agree on governance, compared to non-European respondents.

What are the major differences in consumer attitudes across Europe, having dominated by the Swedish Consumer Group (US) and the UK. Switzerland is the most skeptical, with 23 percent disagreed that brands are committed to sustainability — followed by Scandinavia (20 percent), and its consumers in Mexico (39 percent) and iran (20 percent).

"Brand Finance's research consistently shows that perceptions of corporate brands vary significantly across regions, with sustainability being a key area where European consumers set a higher standard,” says Rob Haigh, Strategy & Sustainability Director at Brand Finance, a leading global brand. "Europe continues to lead in sustainability regulations, particularly with the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD).

“Sustainability claims must always be genuine and supported by real practices," he added. "But this is particularly true in Europe — where any real or perceived greenwashing is likely to be more rapidly exposed."

How Can You Make SCIENTIFIC PAPERS?

In the context of sustainable development, sustainability is defined as a form of intergenerational ethics.

The issue of understanding of climate change and sustainability touches on many other research issues and questions like the public’s trust in science; attitudes to, and understanding of, risk perception; and the spread of conspiracy theories. Moreover, interest in this area has led to an interest in a number of interesting and important topics, like geo-engineering and transitioning to a green economy, which is well beyond the scope of this review.

First, nature-related principles aim to decarbonize, reduce the human environmental impact by efficiency, sufficiency, and consistency; be net-positive; prefer local, seasonal, plant-based, and labor-intensive; and esped the polluter-pays principle. Second, personal principles aim to practice contemplation, apply policies with caution, and celebrate frugality. Fourth, systems-related principles aim to apply systems thinking; foster diversity; be more transparent; and maintain or increase option diversity. This emphasizes the multi-

There is a deeply ideological component to the concept of sustainability. There is also the issue of the extent to which people support the essential goals of sustainability as they understand them. Assuming one can assess reliably and validly some of the features of sustainability, there are inevitable individual differences in the extent to which certain claims are thought to be true. There are also differences in perceived means and the ends (i.e., how to be sustainable).

In some parts of the world, the most clear focus of this issue is probably probably climate change and biodiversity loss. Both of these issues have been heavily politicized: the scientific findings have been challenged and all recommendations for behavioral change have been, and are constantly, debated.

Why do people become so cynical and skeptical of the messages of many climate scientists. It looks at the research that attempted to differentiate between different skeptical positions, be it using a dimensional or categorical approach. The major concern of many researchers is to understand how and why people reject certain messages and, therefore, how their views may be changed.

It appears that regardless of how worldviews are measured (e.g., political conservatism or free-market libertarianism), a strong and robust correlation (accounting for up to 50% of the variance) emerges between right-wing political attitudes and CC skepticism.

It has very little interest in socio-political liberalism than conservatism. But, like psychologists, which interests and puzzles them, sociologists undertake that opposite – namely, investigating deviance.

With respect to sustainability skepticism, Wilson developed a psychological and a test of conservatism that has generated significant interest. Wilson suggested that conservative attitudes are influenced by both genetic and environmental factors that shape feelings of insecurity and a desire to preserve stability. The common thread of this syndrome is the susceptibility to experience threat or anxiety when faced with uncertainty. Individuals with a conservative outlook on environmental issues often seek to avoid uncertainty both in terms of environmental changes and the responses to them, favoring approaches that emphasize stability, preservation,

Energy communities and consumer ownership in renewable energy (RE) are essential cornerstones of the Energy Transition. When consumers acquire ownership in RE installations, they become prosumers, generating a share of the energy they consume. This not only helps reduce their overall energy expenditure but also provides an additional source of income through the sale of excess production.

What is responsible for prosumership for energy generation, supply and management are expected to grow in number on an annual basis, in the context of the proliferation of energy resources. In our paper, we define this evolving landscape as “renewable energy clusters” (RE clusters).

Nonetheless, the governance model of energy clusters and the engineering model of energy communities are recognized in practice. Furthermore, clear and standardized definitions are still emerging.

Human needs evolved at the age of 15 and these are all important psychological needs of an individual. Human values began with exploration of fundamental human needs. One of the earliest frameworks identified five basic needs: physiological, safety, love, esteem, and self-actualization.

Further research on values at the individual level emphasized their intrinsic importance, independent of external objects or events. Values can be categorized into two main types: terminal values, which represent ideal end states or ultimate life goals, and instrumental values, which define the behaviors and virtues necessary to achieve those goals. While terminal values reflect aspirations for an ideal society or personal fulfillment, instrumental values guide the actions needed to reach those aspirations.

Customer Value is typically measured using Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), which represents the net profit a customer generates for a company over their lifetime and can be expressed in monetary terms.

Is value primarily a measure of financial profit?

This study defines value by merging various perspectives and addressing the ambiguity of existing definitions. It introduces three key terms: life value, user value, and product/service value.

Life value refers to desirable states of existence or modes of behavior. Desirable states of existence—such as freedom, equality, and salvation—represent ideal future conditions individuals aspire to reach. Modes of behavior—such as self-control, honesty, and generosity—refer to guiding principles that individuals establish for themselves.

As a subset of life value, user value is directly linked to a particular product or service. The elements of user value vary depending on the product or service in question.

What is the difference between user value and product value, when they are categorized into the terms customer value, service value, or quality value?

Life Value, User Value, Product/Service Value is dynamic. User Value elements of a given product or service can influence life value elements of a given individual, while life value elements, in turn, shape user value elements. The concept of user experience refers to all aspects of interactions between a user and a product or service, whereas life experience encompasses everything that happens to an individual, contributing to knowledge, emotions, and skills.

My writing is based on two basic assumptions: I am a lawyer and foreigner. A lawyer is a lawyer, and I am to study more now. If I do not, I can't help myself, and have no idea what I can do to solve it myself, this study is based on two fundamental assumptions, I don't know what the answer will be; I am going to find out how I can solve it myself, and I don't know what the solution will be. If I do not understand it than I

"Value" is a multi-dimensional construct – An individual may pursue multiple value elements simultaneously.

The influence of value elements on user behavior depends on context – Situational factors, such as personal circumstances and external conditions, impact how value is perceived and pursued.

Previous research has highlighted the role of context in shaping value. For instance, human needs may diminish after being satisfied, and situational variables—including physical surroundings, social environments, time constraints, task definitions, and prior conditions—affect behavior. While understanding these situational influences is important, this study focuses primarily on clarifying user value itself. Future research may explore the role of personality, attitudes, and situational factors in shaping user value.

Numerous definitions of consumer value are rooted in the economic paradigm, where value is primarily determined by the monetary sacrifice individuals are willing to make for a product. This perspective emphasizes the point of exchange, with money serving as a key indicator of value. The assumption is that, at the moment of purchase, consumers engage in a rational evaluation, weighing the cost against the perceived quality of the product.

In the context of design, however, the approach may be limiting, particularly in the context of use, as it neglects the situation of use. Studies on consumer value suggest that non-monetary factors also play a crucial role in shaping perceptions of value. For example, when assessing fruit beverages, factors such as time and effort required for preparation influences how users perceive product value.

Is being money for product quality an adequate way to establish a value for customers?
